# Possibility of a raceCondition attack identified.

## Summary
A situation whereby multiple calls are made to the `setTokenRemappings` function simultaneously, and they assign different values to the same tokens, which can result in an unpredictable final remapped token. This can be challenging to determine which transaction or call was responsible for setting the final value.

## Vulnerability Detail
When there's a concurrent call to modify the `remappedTokens` mapping, this can result in unpredictable behavior when multiple calls attempt to modify the same key-value pairs simultaneously.

In an event where two or more transactions modify the same token remapping at the same time, it can result in unpredictable or inconsistent behavior.

## Impact
Since the `function setTokenRemappings(` function in line "47" is only restricted to the contract owner, there is a potential for a race condition where multiple calls to the function can be made simultaneously, and remapping of tokens can be set to different values.

In this scenario, it is possible that the last call to the function will set the final value of the `remapped token`, and this can surely result in other calls to the function being overwritten.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function should be made "reentrant-safe" by adding the `nonReentrant` modifier or by implementing a mutex lock to ensure that the function is not called concurrently.
