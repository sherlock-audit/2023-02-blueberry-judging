# User could bypass the `MaxLTV`

## Summary
Users can use this method with the different functions we just use `reducePosition()` to explain it 

## Vulnerability Detail
Alice open a position with `strategyId == ID01` and `collToken == TokenA`
The MaxLTV of `TokenA` in the strategy `ID01` is 2.5X.

These are the critical values of Alice's position
getPositionValue Is: 20k USD
getDebtValue Is: 20k USD
getUnderlyingValue Is: 10k USD

Now, Alice invokes `reducePosition()` with `strategyId == ID02`
The MaxLTV of `TokenA` in the strategy `ID02` is 3X.

So, the [_validateMaxLTV()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L101-L113) will do the check calculation with a different maxLTV

and this will lead to a wrong check 

## Impact
the user will reduce his position more than it should

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to check `strategy.vault` with `pod.collId`
