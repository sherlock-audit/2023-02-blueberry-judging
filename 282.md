# Users can avoid paying fee to the treasury, by using `openPosition()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
- Alice will invoke [openPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L166-L189)
with `collAmount == 3000 ICHI` (1 ICHI == $5) ==> $5 * 3000 = $15000
and `borrowAmount == 5000 USDC` (1 USDC == $1) ==> $1 * 5000 = $5000
the `strategyId` LTV is 3X

These are the critical values of Alice's position
getPositionValue Is: 5000 USD
getDebtValue Is: 5000 USD
getUnderlyingValue Is: 14925 USD

Now, in the case of the ICHI price down.
- Alice rather than invoking `increasePosition()` to support his position (this will lead him to pay `depositFee ` and next he will pay `withdrawFee` )
He can simply Transfer some USDC to SPELL first and immediately invoke [openPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L166-L189) with `collAmount == 0` and `borrowAmount == 0`

and now he supports his position.

## Impact
Users can avoid paying fees to the treasury

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function openPosition(
        uint256 strategyId,
        address collToken,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 collAmount,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    )
        external
        existingStrategy(strategyId)
        existingCollateral(strategyId, collToken)
    {
        // 1-3 Deposit on ichi vault
        depositInternal(
            strategyId,
            collToken,
            borrowToken,
            collAmount,
            borrowAmount
        );

        // 4. Put collateral - ICHI Vault Lp Token
        address vault = strategies[strategyId].vault;
        doPutCollateral(vault, IERC20(vault).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
