# The contract should use approve(0) before approve

## Summary

`BlueBerryBank` uses `SafeERC20Upgradeable` for `IERC20Upgradeable` which has an issue in approve.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

## Impact

Silent Failure of approve.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: BlueBerryBank.sol

647:    IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(bank.softVault, amount);

652:    IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(bank.hardVault, amount);

882:    IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(bank.cToken, amountCall);

```
