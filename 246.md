# `withdrawVaultFee` coud be evaded in `HardVault.withdraw` and `SoftVault.withdraw`

## Summary
When withdraw token from `HardVault`, the `fee` may becomes 0 due to precision loss, making the user withdraw freely.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the `ProtocolConfig.sol` and `BlueberryConst.col`, `withdrawVaultFee` = 100, and `DENOMINATOR` = 10000. For example, when withdrawing 99 USDC(which is 0.000099$) each time, the fee computed by 
```solidity
uint256 fee = (withdrawAmount * config.withdrawVaultFee()) /
                DENOMINATOR;
```
is 99 * 100 / 10000 = 0. In this way the fee is evaded. By calling `withdraw` multiple times with small amout each time, the user can withdraw all assets for free without paying a fee.

## Impact

Although currently, it does not seem profitable to carry out an attack of this kind according to gas price, this attack vector exists and should be prevented.
