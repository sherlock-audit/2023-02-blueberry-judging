# Repay only whitelisted tokens leading to users to be unable to pay their debts

## Summary
When users call function ```closePosition()``` or ```closePositionFarm()```, users need to repay  his debt. However ,if the token is removed from the whitelist, users are not able to repay it any more.


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function repay(address token, uint256 amountCall)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
        onlyWhitelistedToken(token)
    {
        if (!isRepayAllowed()) revert REPAY_NOT_ALLOWED();
        (uint256 amount, uint256 share) = repayInternal(
            POSITION_ID,
            token,
            amountCall
        );
        emit Repay(POSITION_ID, msg.sender, token, amount, share);
    }
```
If users want to close their position , users need to repay his debts. As the code above ,only  whitelisted tokens can be used to repay debts. If the token is removed from the whitelist, users are not able to repay it any more.
As far as I understand, the whitelist is mostly needed to control allowed tokens when depositing or borrowing. If the protocol want to block new mints of these tokens, the protocol remove it from the whitelist, but this way also block the repay debts.  Some users may not be able to pay their debts until they are liquidated or the owner re-adds the token to the whitelist.

## Impact
 Some users may not be able to pay their debts

## Recommendation
```solidity
remove  modifier```onlyWhitelistedToken()``` for function ```repay()```
    function repay(address token, uint256 amountCall)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
    {
        if (!isRepayAllowed()) revert REPAY_NOT_ALLOWED();
        (uint256 amount, uint256 share) = repayInternal(
            POSITION_ID,
            token,
            amountCall
        );
        emit Repay(POSITION_ID, msg.sender, token, amount, share);
    }

```
