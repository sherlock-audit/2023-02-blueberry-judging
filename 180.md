# UniswapV2Oracle reverts for pool with token with >18 decimals

## Summary

UniswapV2Oracle.getPrice reverts when evaluating the token price for a pool between two tokens whose decimals sum to over 36, i.e.: if one token has the normal 18 decimals and the other has more than 18. This bricks IchiVaultSpell.

## Vulnerability Detail

UniswapV2Oracle.getPrice contains the formula: `36 - token0.decimals() - token1.decimals()`. This underflows when one of the tokens is a normal 18 decimals and the other contains more than 18 decimals, such as YAM-V2, which has 24 decimals. In the version of Solidity used, this  formula will always revert. This bricks IchiVaultSpell, as most of its fuctions will transitively call  getPrice().

## Impact

Unable to open positions on the LP tokens for a UniswapV2 pool one of whose underlying tokens has more than 18 decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When token0.decimals() + token1.decimals() > 36, divide by 10**( token0.decimals() + token1.decimals() - 36), instead of multiplying by 10 ** (36 - token0.decimals() - token1.decimals()).
