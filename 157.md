# takeCollateral is open to re-entrancy if setAllowContractCalls is set to true

## Summary

the function takeCollateral is vulnerable to re-entrancy if setAllowContractCalls is set to true 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where setAllowContractCalls is set to true. Bob, a malicious actor can open a position from a smart contract that does not implement an ERC1155 receiver, so when he uses the attack smart contract to call takeCollateral, the transaction will revert but not until the size of the collateral is reduced.

The size of the collateral is updated before the transfer 



## Impact
A malicious actor can reduce the size of his/her collateral in the position without actually taking back the collateral, effectively reducing it to 0.

## Recommendation

A possible fix would be to change the balance after the transfer has been made
