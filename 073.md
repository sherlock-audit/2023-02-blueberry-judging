# Fee on transfer tokens are not supported

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens are not supported and allow user to borrow more than he should.
## Vulnerability Detail
Amount that user can borrow [depends on position.underlyingAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L109-L112). The more underlyingAmount is, more amount user can borrow.

When user lends to bank, this amount [is increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L643-L644). Then underlying token is [deposited to the soft or hard vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L646-L657).

In case if fee on transfer token will be used as collateral, then amount, that will be added to `position.underlyingAmount` will be bigger than amount that is received by soft or hard vault.
As result user will be able to borrow more, then he should.

Example.
1. User deposits 1000 fee on transfer tokens
2. Fee is collected, so vault received only 950 tokens, but `position.underlyingAmount` is set to 1000.
3. User has 50 additional tokens that increase his borrow capacity.
## Impact
Ltv is calculated incorrectly.

## Recommendation
You need increase `position.underlyingAmount` with received amount.
