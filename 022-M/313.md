# `getPositionIdsByOwner()` will always be reverted if `nextPositionId` is too big

## Summary

`getPositionIdsByOwner()` will always be reverted if `nextPositionId` is too big. If some third-party protocols try to integrate with Blueberry, they will fail to get results of `getPositionIdsByOwner()` due to too many positions in Blueberry bank.

## Vulnerability Detail

`getPositionIdsByOwner()` gets all position ids of a specific owner, the function iterates all `positions[]` array to find ids.

But if the `nextPositionId` is too big, the for loop will always be reverted. Nobody is able to get the results of `getPositionIdsByOwner()`.

## Impact

Third-party protocols will always be reverted when they call `getPositionIdsByOwner()` due to too many positions in Blueberry bank. It causes the loss of third-party protocols, and also the decline of blueberry's reputation.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Use pagination in `getPositionIdsByOwner()`, or create a mapping for owner and positionIds.
