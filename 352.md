# ICHI rewards not paid out when reopening a farm position

## Summary

When a position on the ICHIFarm gets reopened, ICHI rewards from the previous position are not send to the user and can be taken by someone else.

## Vulnerability Detail

When shares of `WIchiFarm` are burned, rewards can be sent out to the msg.sender:

```js
//WIchiFarm.burn
if (enIchi > stIchi) {
    ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, enIchi - stIchi);
}
```

A burn of `WIchiFarm` shares can occur when a position in the farm is closed or when a position is opened while there is already an existing one:

```js
// IchiVaultSpell.closePositionFarm
wIchiFarm.burn(collId, lpTakeAmt);
...
doRefund(ICHI);

// IchiVaultSpell.openPositionFarm
wIchiFarm.burn(collId, collSize);
```

The current implementation of `IchiVaultSpell.openPositionFarm` lacks the refund of ICHI tokens. Hence the rewards that a user should have gotten here remain in the Spell contract and can be taken by anyone who calls `closePositionFarm`.

## Impact

Theft of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a call to `doRefund(ICHI)` in the `IchiVaultSpell.openPositionFarm` when a position gets reopened.
