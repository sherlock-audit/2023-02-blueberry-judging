# `getDebtValue` doesn't accrue borrow interest, breaking integrations and allowing more than maximal LTV

## Summary
The `getDebtValue` function calculates the debt of a position without accruing position's borrow interest beforehand. This affects two functions:
1. the `isLiquidatable` function will return `false` for a position that can be liquidated;
1. the `reducePosition` will allow the user to borrow more than is allowed by the maximal LTV.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [getDebtValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L451) function calculates the debt of a position. To do that the function check the [share of the position in the debt of every bank](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L466-L468). Bank's debt is the amount of tokens that was borrowed + the borrow interest that was accumulated over time. Since borrowing is integrated with Compound, it's required to synchronized bank's total debt value with that of the related cTokenâ€“this is done in the [accrue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L254-L256) function. However, bank's debt is not synchronized in the `getDebtValue` function: the borrow interest accrued since the last `accrue` call won't be counted; bank's debt will be lower than the debt of the cToken. As a result, the functions that use `getDebtValue` will be impacted:
1. [getPositionRisk](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L477) will return a healthier risk of the position, failing to detect positions that are already below the healthy threshold;
1. [isLiquidatable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L497), which depends on `getPositionRisk`, will fail to detect liquidable positions, due to not taking into account the increased debt;
1. [reducePosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L266) will let users to remove a portion of their collateral pass the [maximal LTV check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L273): users, basically, will be allowed to borrow more funds than allowed by the strategy.
## Impact
1. the `isLiquidatable` function will return `false` for a position that can be liquidated;
1. the `reducePosition` will allow the user to borrow more than is allowed by the maximal LTV.

Overall, bad debt may accumulate for the protocol due to undercounted debt.

## Recommendation
In the `getDebtValue` function, consider accruing borrow interest for all banks in which the position has debts.
