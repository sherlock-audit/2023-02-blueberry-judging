# Chainlink API may return stale prices

## Summary
When using the latestroundData function to fetch prices from a chainlink price feed/feed registry, it is important to make sure that it returns correct and fresh prices. The answer that is returned may be carried over from the previous round

## Vulnerability Detail
There are insufficient checks to deal with stale prices from Chainlink. There should be a require(answeredInround >= roundID) statement for tracking which round data is being used, and fallback to alternate oracles by the guardian if this check reverts.

## Impact
Stale prices in a volatile market can be detrimental to the protocol's execution. All functions like borrow and liquidate depend on the getPrice functionality. If the returned price becomes outdated, there maybe a loss of funds to users until guardian changes the oracle address.

## Recommendation
