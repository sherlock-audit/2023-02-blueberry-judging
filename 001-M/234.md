# Data returned from latestRoundData() not sufficiently checked

## Summary
In the ChainlinkAdapterOracle, the data returned from registry.latestRoundData is not checked sufficiently.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L80
^^ There is only a check on updatedAt. answeredInRound is not checked. It's possible for the price to be stale.

## Impact
The price returned might be stale. Since many parts of the protocol need to get the price of assets (collateral, debt, underlyingToken), inaccurate price can lead to loss for the protocol or the users.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata
In addition to the updatedAt check, it's best to also check `answer > 0`, `answeredInRound >= roundID` (prevent stale price), `timestamp != 0` (prevent incomplete round)
