# Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function missing check for round completeness

## Summary

The function `getPrice` in the ChainlinkAdapterOracle contract doesn't contain a check for round completeness which could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. Thus the protocol functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getPrice` in the ChainlinkAdapterOracle contract calls the function `latestRoundData()` to get the price of a given token  using chainlink price feeds but even though the timestamp is checked there is no check for round completeness, this can lead to stale prices as according to Chainlink's documentation the function `latestRoundData()` does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or an outdated round data.

## Impact

If for some reason this issue occurs it can impact the protocol as the Chainlink oracle is used in the calculation of the users collateral/debt value and thus of the risk of their position and liquidability, meaning than an error in the oracle can potentially lead to :

- some users could be liquidated when they should not

- no liquidation is performed when there should be

- causing inappropriate loan being taken, beyond the current collateral health factor.

Note that this issue can only cause big problems for the protocol if the Chainlink oracle is used as the only source in the function AggregatorOracle.getPrice.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to verify the round completeness : 

```solidity
function getPrice(address _token) external view override returns (uint256) {
    // remap token if possible
    address token = remappedTokens[_token];
    if (token == address(0)) token = _token;

    uint256 maxDelayTime = maxDelayTimes[token];
    if (maxDelayTime == 0) revert NO_MAX_DELAY(_token);

    // try to get token-USD price
    uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
    (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(
        token,
        USD
    );
    if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
        revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
    if (answeredInRound < roundID)
        revert INCOMPLETED_ROUND(_token);

    return (answer.toUint256() * 1e18) / 10**decimals;
}
```
