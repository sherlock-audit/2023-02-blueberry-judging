# Inadequate Transaction Reversion Due to Lack of Error Handling.

## Summary
There is no proper error handling, and it doesn't revert transactions in case of errors, which can lead to consequences such as funds being lost, or the contract state being corrupted. Now for instance, if `deposit` or `withdraw` function of the contract is called with a zero $0 $USDT, the code will not properly revert the transaction and may result in funds being lost forever or the contract state being corrupted.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L77
This line of code transfers `amount` of token from the sender to the contract without checking the return value of the `safeTransferFrom` function. If the `safeTransferFrom` function fails, the contract will continue executing as if the transfer was successful, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

## Impact
Although the "deposit" and "withdraw" functions have a check for zero amount, but it does not properly revert the transaction in case of an error. This means that if a user tries to deposit or withdraw an amount of zero, the function will continue to execute instead of reverting the transaction.

As result of the error not being handled correctly, can have a significant impact on the security and reliability of the contract. In particular, it can lead to loss of funds for users who attempt to deposit or withdraw an amount of zero(s), and it can also lead to incorrect accounting of balances and transactions. Additionally.

This issue can make it easier for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities in the code or the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To revert the transaction in case of errors, the code can use the `revert` statement.

Here I suggest the following modifications to the code to add proper error handling:

```solidity
function deposit(address token, uint256 amount)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shareAmount)
{
    require(amount != 0, ZERO_AMOUNT());
    IERC20Upgradeable uToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
    uint256 uBalanceBefore = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    uToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 uBalanceAfter = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    shareAmount = uBalanceAfter - uBalanceBefore;
    _mint(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(token)), shareAmount, "");

    emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount, shareAmount);
}

function withdraw(address token, uint256 shareAmount)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 withdrawAmount)
{
    require(shareAmount != 0, ZERO_AMOUNT());
    IERC20Upgradeable uToken = IERC20Upgradeable(token);
    _burn(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(token)), shareAmount);
    withdrawAmount = shareAmount;

    // Cut withdraw fee if it is in withdrawVaultFee Window (2 months)
  
```
You can see that `require` statement is used to check for an error condition and revert the transaction with a provided error message if the condition is not met. This way you ensure that any subsequent statements in the function are not executed, preventing the execution of unintended operations and preserving the integrity of the smart contract state.
