# Ichi vault LP oracle is vulnerable to price manipulation with flashloan

## Summary
The protocol relies on an oracle to price Ichi Lp shares, unfortunately it is vulnerable to price manipulation using a flash-loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function getTotalAmounts:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/IchiLpOracle.sol#L27

is defined as such in Ichi vaults:

```solidity
/**
    @notice Calculates total quantity of token0 and token1 in both positions (and unused in the ICHIVault)
    @param total0 Quantity of token0 in both positions (and unused in the ICHIVault)
    @param total1 Quantity of token1 in both positions (and unused in the ICHIVault)
*/
function getTotalAmounts()
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256 total0, uint256 total1)
{
    (, uint256 base0, uint256 base1) = getBasePosition();
    (, uint256 limit0, uint256 limit1) = getLimitPosition();
    total0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)).add(base0).add(limit0);
    total1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)).add(base1).add(limit1);
}
```

where `getBasePosition` and `getLimitPosition` fetch available liquidity from UniswapV3 pools. 
A big swap using a flash-loan can push the liquidity to one side only, meaning that a position will contain only token1 for example. If that is the most valuable token according to base oracles, the lp token itself will appear more valuable. 
This will allow the attacker to drain the protocol, by borrowing against over valued collateral.


## Impact
An attacker can drain the protocol by borrowing against overvalued collateral.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One can use the same logic as the IchiVault itself uses to protect against price manipulation on UniswapV3: using a twap oracle as reference and revert if the price has deviated too much in the same block:
