# Chainlink's latestRoundData may return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Freshness check should be applied on Chainlink's latestRoundData() function to ensure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation of ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol's latestRoundData() function, there a lack of proper freshness checks. This could lead to stale prices being used.

For example, if the market price of the token drops rapidly and Chainlink's feed does not get updated in a timely manner, the smart contract will continue to believe the token is worth more than the market value.

## Impact
Stale prices may be used.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the missing freshness check for stale price:

require(answer > 0, "Chainlink answer <= 0");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
require(updatedAt != 0, "Round not complete");
