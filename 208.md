# Chainlink's latestRoundData may return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Freshness check should be applied on Chainlink's latestRoundData() function to ensure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation of ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol's latestRoundData() function, there is no freshness check. This could lead to stale prices being used.

If the market price of the token drops very quickly and Chainlink's feed does not get updated in time, the smart contract will continue to believe the token is worth more than the market value.

## Impact
Stale prices may be used.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the missing freshness check for stale price.

``require(answer > 0, "error message");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "error message");
require(updatedAt > 0, "error message");``
