# HardVault supports ERC20 token instead of ERC1155 tokens

## Summary

HardVault uses the incorrect ERC token interface according to the docs. This means that there is no way for a user to deposit ERC1155 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The docs state that the hard vault is designed for users to lend ERC1155 shown here

However, the code displays the underlying token as an ERC20 implementation instead of the ERC1155 as shown in the docs shown here

Here under line 77, the function asks the user to supply ERC20 token (uToken) to deposit instead of ERC1155 tokens as per the docs.

This same issue is also found in the function lend in the blueberry bank contract

as well as withdrawlend

## Impact
The code in the protocol does not match its intended design in the docs, meaning that there is no way for users to lend ERC1155 tokens

## Recommendation

Change the ERC20 interface in the HardVault and other references to it to ERC1155 to match the docs and the intended design
