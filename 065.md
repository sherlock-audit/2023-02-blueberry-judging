# [H] Missing deadline and price checks can allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
The `withdrawInternal()` in `ichiVaultSpell.sol` has a swap function which does not implement a deadline check nor a price check that executes on Uniswap. This missing checks might enable pending transactions to be maliciously executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
when swapping assets, the function must include a deadline and another check to see if the amount received is at least equal to a minimum amount. This is to avoid a possible sandwich attack by MEV bots.

Let’s take an example here:

1. Alice submits a transaction involving the `withdrawInternal()` with a lower transaction fee.
2. It does not get picked up by a miner due to the low transaction fee and stays in the mempool.
3. The token price changes during this time and also the maximum slippage value gets outdated. This would cause a huge slippage
4. An MEV bot finds this, Sandwiches Alice’s transaction and profits from it.

## Impact
A sandwich attack is possible when closing a position on Blueberry. 

Since there are no checks implemented after the swap has been made, the user might get the full amount, however, there might be losses for Blueberry.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a deadline modifier like what uniswap has implemented

```solidity
modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Transaction too old');
        _;
    }
```

And also check if the amount received from the swap is greater than what was expected. Something like below would work:

```solidity
(int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = swapPool.swap( // PARAMS )

// REST OF THE CODE

if (amountOut < minOut) {
            revert TooLittleOut(amountOut, minOut);
        }
```
