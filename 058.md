# DOS attack to Borrow() when bank total debt is low.

## Summary
A malicious user can launch a DOS attack to ``Borrow()`` when bank total debt is low. All he needs to do is to pay off the whole debt for the bank DIRECTLY through the underlying ``bank.ctoken`` (compound) protocol. As a result, it will cause a divide-by-zero revert for the ``borrow()`` function. The ``borrow()`` will revert for that token forever. This DOS can be launched to freeze all the banks.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see how a malicious user can launch a DOS attack to ```Borrow()`` when bank total debt is low.

1) Suppose there is a bank for token X and it has a very low total debt now. For example, right after the protocol is launched. Let ``bank.totalShare = 100`` and ``bank.totalDebt = 100``.

2)  The attacker, Bob, can also front-run other borrowers and become the first borrower to set up the above state: ``bank.totalShare = 100`` and ``bank.totalDebt = 100``.

3) Attacker Bob then repays all  the debt for the bank, not via ``BlueBerryBank``, but directly through the underlying borrowing protocol, ``bank.ctoken``, settting the ``BlueBerryBank``'s address as the payee, and Bob's wallet address at the payer. As a result, the bank's total debt becomes zero. That is ``bank.totalShare = 100`` and ``bank.totalDebt = 0``.

4) Another user Alice tries to call ``borrow()`` to borrow token X. however, L723 will always revert due to a divide-by-zero error since  ``bank.totalDebt = 0``. Therefore, nobody can use ``borrow()`` to borrow token X anymore.

5) The attack can be launched for banks for any other tokens in ``BlueBerryBank``.

## Impact
A DOS attack can be launched for any bank in the  ``BlueBerryBank``. The attack will be more affordable when the debt is low, for example, when the protocol is just launched. 
Nobody can use ``borrow()`` for that token anymore after the attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When we see ``bank.totalShare !=0 `` and ``bank.totalDebt = 0``, we will  use 1000 as the denominator. That is, we artificially introduce a small total debt (1000 wei is nothing for most tokens) when there is no debt but there are shares. 

```diff
function borrow(address token, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
        onlyWhitelistedToken(token)
    {
        if (!isBorrowAllowed()) revert BORROW_NOT_ALLOWED();
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        uint256 totalShare = bank.totalShare;
        uint256 totalDebt = bank.totalDebt;
+     if(totalDebt == 0) totalDebt = 1000;  // avoid divide-by-error revert
        uint256 share = totalShare == 0
            ? amount
            : (amount * totalShare).divCeil(totalDebt);
        bank.totalShare += share;
        uint256 newShare = pos.debtShareOf[token] + share;
        pos.debtShareOf[token] = newShare;
        if (newShare > 0) {
            pos.debtMap |= (1 << uint256(bank.index));
        }
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(
            msg.sender,
            doBorrow(token, amount)
        );
        emit Borrow(POSITION_ID, msg.sender, token, amount, share);
    }
```
