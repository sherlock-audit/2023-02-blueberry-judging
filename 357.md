# wrong calculation in logic of the Lend function

## Summary

actually, the protocol stores the amount of the underlying token after the fee cut but if the token has the fees it will be wrong because there are fewer tokens with the higher fake amount 

## Vulnerability Detail
some tokens have fees in transferring process and the lend protocol also do cutting fee it will make issue because after that it gives us ` amount = doCutDepositFee(token, amount);` amount and protocol stores that 
```solidity
 pos.underlyingToken = token;
        pos.underlyingAmount += amount;
```
Some tokens take a transfer fee `(e.g. STA, PAXG)`
## Impact
the amount that stored in protocol will not match with the tokens that really in the contract and it will cause really big problems and protocol insolvency 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function lend(address token, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
        onlyWhitelistedToken(token)
    {
        if (!isLendAllowed()) revert LEND_NOT_ALLOWED();

        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (pos.underlyingToken != address(0)) {
            // already have isolated collateral, allow same isolated collateral
            if (pos.underlyingToken != token)
                revert INCORRECT_UNDERLYING(token);
        }

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            pos.owner,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        amount = doCutDepositFee(token, amount);
        pos.underlyingToken = token;
        pos.underlyingAmount += amount;

        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(bank.softVault, amount);
            pos.underlyingVaultShare += ISoftVault(bank.softVault).deposit(
                amount
            );
        } else {
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).approve(bank.hardVault, amount);
            pos.underlyingVaultShare += IHardVault(bank.hardVault).deposit(
                token,
                amount
            );
        }

        bank.totalLend += amount;

        emit Lend(POSITION_ID, msg.sender, token, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
- **have logic for  tokens that has fees**
- consider not allowing the tokens with fees or...
