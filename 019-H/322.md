# Failure to withdraw Ichi vault LP tokens to the user

## Summary

A user is able to specify an amount `amountLpWithdraw` to withdraw ICHI vault LP tokens from their owned position directly to the user. However, due to a bug in the calculation of the amount of LP tokens to withdraw, the requested tokens are not transferred to the user and instead remain stuck in the spell contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `IchiVaultSpell.closePosition` function first withdraws `lpTakeAmt` collateral (ICHI vault LP tokens) from the bank that was previously deposited when opening the position.

The `closePosition` function allows a user to specify an amount `amountLpWithdraw` of ICHI vault LP tokens to withdraw and to transfer back to the caller (user). This parameter is passed on to the `IchiVaultSpell.withdrawInternal` function.

In the `IchiVaultSpell.withdrawInternal` function, the amount of ICHI vault LP tokens to withdraw is calculated in **step 2** by subtracting the specified `amountLpWithdraw` parameter from the current ICHI vault LP token balance (collateral that have been withdrawn previously from the bank - see [`IchiVaultSpell.closePosition#L355`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L355)).

If a **non-zero value** is provided as `amountLpWithdraw`, the amount of ICHI vault LP tokens to withdraw from the ICHI vault will be correspondingly lower.
The remaining ICHI vault LP tokens, which are not used to withdraw from the ICHI vault, remain in the spell contract and are **not refunded to the caller**.

It is worth noting that any other user or MEV bot can create a new ICHI vault spell position and withdraw those leftover ICHI vault LP tokens by closing the position.

In contrast, the Alpha Homora `SushiswapSpellV1` implementation refunds (transfers) any LP tokens intended to be withdrawn by the user (`amtLPWithdraw`) in [line 338](https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/alpha-homora-v2-contract/blob/f74fc460bd614ad15bbef57c88f6b470e5efd1fd/contracts/spell/SushiswapSpellV1.sol#L338).

## Impact

ICHI vault LP tokens intended to be withdrawn and transferred to the user (caller) are not transferred to the user and remain stuck in the spell contract. The user lost those LP tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider refunding the remaining Ichi vault LP tokens using `doRefund(address(vault));` at the end of the `IchiVaultSpell.withdrawInternal` function.
