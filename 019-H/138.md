# LP tokens would get lost while closing a position

## Summary
When executing ````closePosition```` or ````closePositionFarm````, it calls ````withdrawInternal```` to withdraw tokens and refund them to the user. However there is no logic to refund LP tokens, which can make the tokens stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In ````withdrawInternal````, ````amtLPToRemove```` of vault LP tokens are withdrawn, leaving ````amountLpWithdraw```` of tokens still kept in the contract.
```solidity
        // 2. Calculate actual amount to remove
        uint256 amtLPToRemove = vault.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            amountLpWithdraw;

        // 3. Withdraw liquidity from ICHI vault
        vault.withdraw(amtLPToRemove, address(this));

        // 4. Swap withdrawn tokens to initial deposit token
        bool isTokenA = vault.token0() == borrowToken;
        uint256 amountToSwap = IERC20(
            isTokenA ? vault.token1() : vault.token0()
        ).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amountToSwap > 0) {
            swapPool = IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool());
            swapPool.swap(
                ...
            );
        }

        // 5. Withdraw isolated collateral from Bank
        doWithdraw(collToken, amountShareWithdraw);

        // 6. Repay
        doRepay(borrowToken, amountRepay);

        _validateMaxLTV(strategyId);

        // 7. Refund
        doRefund(borrowToken);
        doRefund(collToken);
    }
```

After repaying the loan and withdrawing the initial collaterals, tokens left after repaying(````borrowToken````) and the withdrawn collateral(````collToken````) are refunded to the user. However, there is no logic for refunding/re-depositing the unused LP tokens here.

Technically the tokens are not stuck, but anyone can redeem the excess LP tokens in the contract by executing ````closePosition```` again with appropriate parameters. It would make the contract vulnerable to backrunning attacks.

## Impact
Unredeemed LP tokens would get lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a refunding logic or re-depositing logic for the vault tokens.
```solidity
        // 7. Refund
        doRefund(borrowToken);
        doRefund(collToken);
+       doRefund(vault);
```
or
```solidity
    function closePosition(
    ...
        withdrawInternal(
            strategyId,
            collToken,
            borrowToken,
            amountRepay,
            amountLpWithdraw,
            amountShareWithdraw
        );
+       uint256 lpAmount = IERC20(vault).balanceOf(address(this));
+       if(lpAmount > 0) {
+           address vault = strategies[strategyId].vault;
+           doPutCollateral(vault, lpAmount);
+       }
    }

    function closePositionFarm(
    ...
        withdrawInternal(
            strategyId,
            collToken,
            borrowToken,
            amountRepay,
            amountLpWithdraw,
            amountShareWithdraw
        );
+       uint256 lpAmount = IERC20(vault).balanceOf(address(this));
+       if(lpAmount > 0) {
+           ensureApprove(vault, address(wIchiFarm));
+           uint256 id = wIchiFarm.mint(collId, lpAmount);
+           bank.putCollateral(address(wIchiFarm), id, lpAmount);
+       }
```
