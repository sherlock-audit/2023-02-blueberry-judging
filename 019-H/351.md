# LP tokens might get left in the Spell contract and be taken by someone else

## Summary

LP tokens can get left in the spell contract, enabling someone else to take them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `IchiVaultSpell.closePosition` has a parameter `amountLpWithdraw`. Contrary to its name, the only thing it does is to actually reduce the amount of LP tokens to withdraw from the IchiVault:

```js
uint256 amtLPToRemove = vault.balanceOf(address(this)) -
    amountLpWithdraw;
```

After clarification with the sponsor, the name of this parameter was meant to be `amountLpToLeave`. Regardless of the naming, the problem is that the amounts left in the contract are not handled anywhere currently, so this would cause the LP to remain in the contract until `IchiVaultSpell.closePosition` gets called with `amountLpWithdraw == 0` to withdraw the full balance of the Spell contract. This would allow anyone to take the LPs left behind by someone else.

## Impact

Theft of funds. Severity deemed to be medium due to the requisites of faulty integration/incorrect parameter usage.

## Recommendation
Omit the parameter `amountLpWithdraw` if it is obsolete. Otherwise handle the leftover funds.
