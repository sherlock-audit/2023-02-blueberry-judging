# If the bank.EXECUTOR() is added to the USDC blacklist, then his assets will be frozen in the protocol

## Summary
```doRefund()``` will send token to the bank.EXECUTOR(), if the token is USDC and the bank.EXECUTOR() is added to the USDC blacklist, then doRefund() will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function doRefund(address token) internal {
        uint256 balance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance > 0) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(bank.EXECUTOR(), balance);
        }
    }

```

The closePosition() function call is used to withdraw assets from ICHI Vault, If there are funds left over after paying off the debtï¼Œit will go through the refund process.   The ```doRefund()``` function  will send token to the bank.EXECUTOR(), if the token is USDC and the bank.EXECUTOR() is added to the USDC blacklist(e.g by doing something malicious with that address,etc.), then doRefund() will not work for that user , then his assets will be frozen in the protocol.

## Impact
If the bank.EXECUTOR() is added to the USDC blacklist, then his assets will be frozen in the protocol

```solidity
   function closePosition(
        uint256 strategyId,
        address collToken,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 lpTakeAmt,
        uint256 amountRepay,
        uint256 amountLpWithdraw,
        uint256 amountShareWithdraw,
        address recipient
