# Users can bypass the modifier `existingCollateral`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Adversary users will invoke [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L578-L613)  with `positionId == 0`==> [increasePosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L256-L259 ) with `token == TokenA` this will set `pos.underlyingToken` to **TokenA** which is listed on `whitelistedTokens[]`

Now the user will invoke [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L578-L613)  with `positionId == the ID of the his position` ==> [openPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L166-L189) with `collAmount == 0` , `strategyId == ID01`and `collToken == TokenB`

**Note:** the strategy with **strategyId  == ID01** doesn't accept **TokenA** as a `collToken`, but the Adversary users can bypass this as we mentioned above. 

to withdraw his isolated collateral can invoke `reducePosition()` 

## Impact
Users can bypass the modifier `existingCollateral`
