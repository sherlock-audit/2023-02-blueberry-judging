# Information leakage in the functions `getPositionInfo` and `getCurrentPositionInfo`.

## Summary
Where the functions `getPositionInfo` and `getCurrentPositionInfo` reveal sensitive information about a user's position without proper authorization checks. This allows unauthorized access to information such as the owner's address, underlying token, underlying amount, underlying vault share, collateral token, collateral ID, collateral size, and risk associated with the position.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getPositionInfo` and `getCurrentPositionInfo` functions. These functions return sensitive information about user's position such as the amount of underlying tokens and collateral the users hold without proper authorization checks. Revealing such Sensitive financial information is as much as revealing one's credit card numbers and bank account details and it can be used to steal money or make unauthorized transactions.

Here is the code for the `getPositionInfo` and `getCurrentPositionInfo` function that has the flaws.

## Impact
Any unauthorized party who properly calls the `getPositionInfo` or `getCurrentPositionInfo` functions can see sensitive information about the user's position, which can lead to sensitive information being disclosed and misused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend implementing proper authorization checks in the `getPositionInfo` and `getCurrentPositionInfo` functions. 
These functions should only reveal information to authorized parties, such as the owner of the position or a trusted party designated by the owner.

Implementing this is to add an additional parameter to these functions, representing the authorized party, and adding an if statement to ensure that only the authorized party can access the information.

function getPositionInfo(uint256 positionId, address authorizedParty)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (
        address owner,
        address underlyingToken,
        uint256 underlyingAmount,
        uint256 underlyingVaultShare,
        address collToken,
        uint256 collId,
        uint256 collateralSize,
        uint256 risk
    )
{
    require(authorizedParty == positions[positionId].owner, "Unauthorized access");
    Position storage pos = positions[positionId];
    owner = pos.owner;
    underlyingToken = pos.underlyingToken;
    underlyingAmount = pos.underlyingAmount;
    underlyingVaultShare = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
    collToken = pos.collToken;
    collId = pos.collId;
    collateralSize = pos.collateralSize;
    risk = getPositionRisk(positionId);
}

function getCurrentPositionInfo(address authorizedParty)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (
        address owner,
        address underlyingToken,
        uint256 underlyingAmount,
        uint256 underlyingVaultShare,
        address collToken,
        uint256 collId,
        uint256 collateralSize,
        uint256 risk
    )
{
    require(authorizedParty == positions[POSITION_ID].owner, "Unauthorized access");
    if (POSITION_ID == _NO_ID) revert BAD_POSITION(POSITION_ID);
    return getPositionInfo(POSITION_ID);
}
