# VARIABLES WHICH ARE ASSIGNED FIXED VALUES DURING INITIALIZATION CAN BE DEFINED AS CONSTANTS

## Summary

Variables which are assigned fixed values during initialization of the contract and for which no setter functions are defined to change their respective values can be defined as constants.

## Vulnerability Detail

The variables `withdrawVaultFee` and `withdrawVaultFeeWindow` are defined as public variables in the `ProtocolConfig.sol` contract. And they are initialized fixed values inside the `initialize()` function of the contract. But no setter functions are defined to change their values afterwards. 

## Impact

Since these variables are set fixed values during the initialization of the contract and no setter functions are defined to change their values they can be defined as constants to save gas and better format and readability of the code.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 withdrawVaultFee = 100;
 withdrawVaultFeeWindow = 60 days;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to declare both `withdrawVaultFee` and `withdrawVaultFeeWindow` as constants and save gas during initialization of the contract.
