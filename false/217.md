# Ichi Vault ERC677 Read-only Reentrancy

## Summary
I understand that currently there aren't ERC677 tokens supported, but if they are not programmatically unable to be whitelisted (by checking their standard upon whitelist) they must not introduce vulnerabilities.

If an Ichi Vault supports ERC677, a deposit/withdrawal from it can be manipulated to make the token price extremely low or high. This happens because within the withdrawal function the burning of shares happens after tokens have been transferred out (and in deposit minting occurs after transfer in), and because Blueberry's IchiLPOracle determines LP token price based off of current token balances rather than a scheme like the Uniswap V2 Oracle.

By manipulating the LP token price, a malicious actor can then liquidate all users in the vault and profit from that. If they manipulate price up, they can borrow all funds from a vault and wipe it out.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Malicious actor purchases Ichi position at a normal price.
2. Malicious actor flash loans tokens to deposit a huge amount into the Ichi Vault as token0.
3. When token1 is being transferred from actor to the vault (after many token0 tokens have), on ERC677 callback actor borrows a huge amount from Blueberry.
4. This borrow will be allowed because all flash loaned tokens have entered the Ichi vault, but no new shares have been minted.
5. The flash loaned deposit finishes, then the actor withdraws right away and returns flash loan.

The above can be done opposite to liquidate all users.

## Impact
Can steal large amounts of tokens from Blueberry or liquidate everybody. 

## Code Snippet
Ichi Withdrawal:

```solidity
        if (unusedAmount0 > 0) IERC20(token0).safeTransfer(to, unusedAmount0);
        if (unusedAmount1 > 0) IERC20(token1).safeTransfer(to, unusedAmount1);

        amount0 = base0.add(limit0).add(unusedAmount0);
        amount1 = base1.add(limit1).add(unusedAmount1);

        _burn(msg.sender, shares);
```

Blueberry oracle just using amount * price for LP price.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Depending on where you see the protocol headed I see a few options: explicitly disallow ERC677, require that onlyEOA is calling for anything involving an ERC677, or check that the reentrant modifier isn't active in the Ichi Vault when checking LP price. I rather like that last one if there's a clean way to do it.
