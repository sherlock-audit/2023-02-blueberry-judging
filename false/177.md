# Bank cannot handle balances if Lending vault gets liquidated

## Summary
Protocol stores direct balances of the users, and not as fractional shares. Thus if the vault balance on Lending Protocol changes due to a liquidation event, the protocol breaks and lets earlier withdrawers steal deposits of late withdrawers.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol creates a new position for each user, which can be liquidated if collateral ratios aren't met. But if the balances are very low for a position, then liquidators aren't interested if even the gas fees aren't covered. The softvault however submits all balances as collateral to the Lending Protocol, and thus has one single account.
Since ethereum transaction fees can be of the order of 10usd, if each position has a balance of the order of 10usd, it becomes unprofitable to liquidate them. However, the main vault with the borrows and lends on lending protocol has the cumulative sum of all the accounts and thus can be worth liquidating. If such a liquidation takes place, the soft vault processes withdrawals on a first come first serve basis, and thus will overpay earlier withdrawals and block later ones once out of tokens.
## Impact
Loss of fair share of tokens

Here in withdraw, we see the function asks for `shareAmount` of tokens, while instead it should ask for `shareAmount / totalSupply * cToken.balanceOf(address(this))` tokens to withdraw.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track token balances in softvault as shares. Instead of withdrawing the share amount of tokens, withdraw based on the share fraction, similar to how borrows are calculated.
