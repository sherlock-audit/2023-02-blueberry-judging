## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function takeCollateral(uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        returns (uint256)
    {
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = pos.collateralSize;
        }
        pos.collateralSize -= amount;
        IERC1155Upgradeable(pos.collToken).safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            pos.collId,
            amount,
            ""
        );
        emit TakeCollateral(
            POSITION_ID,
            msg.sender,
            pos.collToken,
            pos.collId,
            amount
