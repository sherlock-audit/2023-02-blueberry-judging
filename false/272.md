# Possible Manipulation of Token prices.

## Summary
The contract does not validate the addresses of the oracle sources. 
The contract doesn't also specify a minimum number of oracle sources.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract does not validate the addresses of the oracle sources, which means that the owner could set a malicious contract or wrong contract(Address(0)) as a primary source, potentially leading to incorrect or manipulated token prices.

Also, The contract does not specify a minimum number of primary sources, which means that the owner could set only one primary source, potentially leading to incorrect or manipulated token prices
## Impact
when a malicious or wrong contract(Address(0)) is used as a primary source it could lead to incorrect or manipulated token prices.
The owner could also set only one primary source, potentially leading to incorrect or manipulated token prices as there is no minimum number of primary sources specified.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a proper validation method to validate the addresses of the oracle sources. i.e A zero address checker.
Also specify a minimum number of primary sources as such as the contract needs to deliver accurate token prices.
