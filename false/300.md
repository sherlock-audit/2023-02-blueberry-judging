# getprice function of the oracle assumes the tokens decimal is limited to 18

## Summary
in `ChainlinkAdapterOracle` contract there is a function `getprice()` this assumes the tokens decimal is by default limited to 18

## Vulnerability Detail
if you look at the `getPrice()` function in line [83 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L83)It'll assumes the tokens decimal is already by default limited to `18` but it's not

## Impact
because the function already assumes the decimal of tokens is by default 18 it cannot work correctly with tokens with lower decimals  
## Code Snippet
```solidty
    return (answer.toUint256() * 1e18) / 10**decimals;
```
