# getPrice() function can return out dated price

## Summary
getPrice() function can return out dated price due to maxDelayTime .
## Vulnerability Detail
getPrice() function will return out dated if the maxDelayTime is not reached , 
 the `setMaxDelayTimes` can set maxDelayTime up to 2 days 
the condition here will pass to return an out dated price .
```solidity 
if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
```
will not revert if the price has changed in the same day if  maxDelayTime is tow days because of the set of  maxDelayTime ! 

POC 
1- admin add some tokens with maxDelayTime 2 days 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/BaseAdapter.sol#L23
`maxDelayTime` will pass as 2 days , 

2- the if will pass as maxDelayTime is 2 days 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L80-L82 

will pass as the price is up to date but the real price has changed ! 
3.  an outdate price `return (answer.toUint256() * 1e18) / 10**decimals;`  
## Impact
out dated price
