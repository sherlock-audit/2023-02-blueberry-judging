# [M] - Withdrawal Fee can be imposed as long as the owner wants to

## Summary

To ensure blueberry protocol has adequate liquidity to sustain its launch, they lock the funds for 60 days. Before that time, users can withdraw, but they will need to pay a 1% withdrawal fee.

However, this fee can continue for as long as the owner wants because the owner could simply call `startVaultWithdrawFee()` from `ProtocolConfig.sol`. Invoking that would reset the time and the users will need to wait another 60 days to withdraw without any fee.

They have explained the same on their website as shown below-

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability occurs in the below function

```solidity
function startVaultWithdrawFee() external onlyOwner {
        withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime = block.timestamp;
    }
```

The owner has the power to call this function whenever he wants to and therefore resets `withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime` to the current timestamp.

`withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime` is then used in `SoftVault.sol` and `HardVault.sol` to check if fee needs to be imposed or not.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 shareAmount)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 withdrawAmount)
    {
        // CODE
        if (
            block.timestamp <
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
                config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
        ) {
            uint256 fee = (withdrawAmount * config.withdrawVaultFee()) /
                DENOMINATOR;
            uToken.safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
            withdrawAmount -= fee;
        }
        // CODE
    }
```

## Impact
Users may need to pay a withdrawal fee for even more than the 2 month period if the owner executes the `startVaultWithdrawFee()` function again.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
I would recommend this code to be included in the initialize() function or add some checks to the current function so that it can only be invoked once.
