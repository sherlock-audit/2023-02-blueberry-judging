# BBMath library is vulnerable to overflow

## Summary

BBMath.sol is vulnerable to Overflow in the [function divCell ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/libraries/BBMath.sol#L7). The line return (a + b - 1) / b could result in potential overflow which may arise when a is of a very large value. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's say a is the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable (a = 2^256 - 1) and b is a small positive integer (b = 10).

Computing (a + b - 1) / b, we get:

(a + b - 1) / b
= (2^256 - 1 + 10 - 1) / 10
= (2^256 + 8) / 10


The calculation involves summing up a and b - 1 together. In this case, the result would be equal to 2^256 + 8, which is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This would result in an integer overflow, which means that the result of the calculation would be incorrect and could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the contract.

OpenZepplin [Math Library ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7ac4349710d3b242dd3ceea3200f1298f1c3d2b3/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L47) has solution for this by distributing the formula as (a - 1) / b + 1 which guarantees overflow never to occur.
