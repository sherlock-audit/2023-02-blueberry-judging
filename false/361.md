# user actually will get less than what he supposed to get

## Summary
user actually will get less than what he supposed to get
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG) and its making problem with do cut process.

## Impact
it will cause  the users not able to get full amount of their money 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawLend(address token, uint256 shareAmount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
    {
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (token != pos.underlyingToken) revert INVALID_UTOKEN(token);
        if (shareAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            shareAmount = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
        }

        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }

        wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
            ? pos.underlyingAmount
            : wAmount;

        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;
        pos.underlyingAmount -= wAmount;
        bank.totalLend -= wAmount;

        wAmount = doCutWithdrawFee(token, wAmount);

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
    }
