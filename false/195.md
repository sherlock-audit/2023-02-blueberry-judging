# LACK  OF DECIMAL CHECK ON setTokenRemappings FUNCTION

## Summary

There is no check here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L47 to see if the decimals of original and remapped 
tokens is the same. 
## Vulnerability Detail

If the decimal of original and remapped tokens(for ex BTC and wBTC) are different , which they can be as there are no checks to
ensure that , the calculations regarding the remapped tokens would yield incorrect results . For example, if remapped token has 21
decimals and the original had 18 , the result would have x1e3 more decimals than there should be .

## Impact

The calculations regarding the remapped tokens would lead to incorrect results if they decimals are different
