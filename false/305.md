# CoreOracle support returns false for supported tokens

## Summary

The `CoreOracle` will return `false` when asked if it supports a token via `support(token)` when the price oracles returns a price of 0 even when the token is supported.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `support(token)` checks if the price of the input token via the oracle and returns false when the price is 0. The price oracle may return 0 while the token is supported for various reasons (notably during initialization).

## Impact

The `support()` function is called by `BlueBerryBank` when whitelisting tokens, which should be done by the owner during initalization, during which time the oracle may return a price of 0.

The external view function of the BlueBerryBank `support` is also impacted and may give inconsistent information to the UI of the website.

## Code Snippet

The support function returns false if price is 0:

The `UniswapV2Oracle` returns 0 for example when the supply is 0:
