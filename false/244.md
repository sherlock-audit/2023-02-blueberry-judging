# The result of the withdraw fee calculation may be `rounded down` due to rounding error in Solidity, which results in that the protocol lose the opportunity to collect the withdraw fee

## Summary
If the `token`, which will be withdrawn, would be a smaller decimals token (i.e. USDC) and the amount withdrawn (`wAmount`) of it would be really small amount, the result of the withdraw fee calculation will be `rounded down` due to rounding error in Solidity. This lead to a bad situation that the protocol lose the opportunity to collect the withdraw fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the ProtocolConfig, the `withdrawFee` is defined as a state variable like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/ProtocolConfig.sol#L13
```solidity
    uint256 public withdrawFee;
```

Within the ProtocolConfig# `initialize()`, 
`50` is assigned into the `withdrawFee` as a default value like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/ProtocolConfig.sol#L34
```solidity
    function initialize(address treasury_) external initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        if (treasury_ == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();
        treasury = treasury_;
        ...
        withdrawFee = 50; // 0.5% as default, base 10000 /// @audit 
```

Within the BlueBerryConst, `DENOMINATOR` is defined and 10000 is assigned as a constant.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/utils/BlueBerryConst.sol#L5
```solidity
uint256 constant DENOMINATOR = 10000;  /// @audit info - BPS (0.01%)
```

Within the BasicSpell# `doWithdraw()`, 
the BlueBerryBank# `withdrawLend()` is called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L89
```solidity
    function doWithdraw(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (amount > 0) {
            bank.withdrawLend(token, amount);  /// @audit
        }
    }
```

Within the BlueBerryBank# `withdrawLend()`, 
`wAmount` of `token` is assigned into the BlueBerryBank# `doCutWithdrawFee()` to deduct a withdraw fee from the `wAmount` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L701
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Withdraw isolated collateral tokens lent to bank. Must only be called from spell while under execution.
     * @param token Isolated collateral token address
     * @param shareAmount The amount of value share token to withdraw.
     */
    function withdrawLend(address token, uint256 shareAmount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
    {
        ...
        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }

        wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
            ? pos.underlyingAmount
            : wAmount;

        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;
        pos.underlyingAmount -= wAmount;
        bank.totalLend -= wAmount;

        wAmount = doCutWithdrawFee(token, wAmount);  /// @audit

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
    }
```

Within the BlueBerryBank# `doCutWithdrawFee()`, 
the fee deducted from the amount withdrawn would be calculated like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L907
```solidity
    function doCutWithdrawFee(address token, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (config.treasury() == address(0)) revert NO_TREASURY_SET();
        uint256 fee = (amount * config.withdrawFee()) / DENOMINATOR;  /// @audit 
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
        return amount - fee;
    }
```

However, within the tokens whitelisted, the tokens that has small number of decimals are included such as USDC. (The number of decimals of USDC is not `1e18` but `1e6`)

If the `token`, which will be withdrawn, would be a smaller decimals token (i.e. USDC) and the amount withdrawn (`wAmount`) of it would be really small amount, a miscalculation will happen like this example:

Example).

Within the BlueBerryBank# `doCutWithdrawFee()`:
Let's say 0.0001 USDC (= `1e2` USDC) is used as the `wAmount` of `token` to be withdraw.
```solidity
uint256 fee = (amount * config.withdrawFee()) / DENOMINATOR; 
uint256 fee = (1e2 * 50) / 10000;  
uint256 fee = 5000 / 10000;    /// @audit - This result will be rounded down due to rounding error in Solidity.
```
As we can see the example case above, if USDC is used as a `token` to be withdrawn and the amount withdrawn (`wAmount`) of it would be really small amount, the result of the withdraw fee calculation will be `rounded down` due to rounding error in Solidity.

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that the protocol lose the opportunity to collect the withdraw fee.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding some logic in order for the protocol to be able to collect the withdraw fee from the really small amount of the smaller decimals tokens (i.e. USDC) within the BlueBerryBank# `doCutWithdrawFee()`.

Or,

Consider adding a limitation for the amount to be withdrawn by adding a validation within the BlueBerryBank# `doCutWithdrawFee()` like this:
```solidity
    function doCutWithdrawFee(address token, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (config.treasury() == address(0)) revert NO_TREASURY_SET();

        /// @audit - Consider adding a limitation for the amount to be withdrawn by adding a validation like this:
        if (amount * config.withdrawFee() < DENOMINATOR) revert AMOUNT_TO_BE_WITHDRAWN_IS_TOO_SMALL();

        uint256 fee = (amount * config.withdrawFee()) / DENOMINATOR;  /// @audit 
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
        return amount - fee;
    }
```
