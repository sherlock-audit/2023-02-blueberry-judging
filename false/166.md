# Addressing a couple of vulnerabilities


## Summary
`maxDelayTimes` mapping, which could allow unauthorized parties to access sensitive information.
`revert` keyword to handle errors, which can allow an attacker to consume more gas than necessary and it may carry out a denial-of-service attack. 


## Vulnerability Detail
1.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/BaseAdapter.sol#L10
In here, Since `maxDelayTimes` mapping is public. so anyone can read the values in the mapping, which can reveal sensitive information about the contract's internal state.

2.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/BaseAdapter.sol#L21
The `revert `keyword is used in the contract to address errors.Think , if the transaction has already done some work before encountering an error, but for this `revert`, the work will be undone and the transaction will not complete successfully.

## Recommendation
1. `maxDelayTimes` mapping should be made `private`, and a function for allowing authorized parties to read the maximum delay time for a specific token should be included in the contract.
2. Use the `require` keyword instead of `revert` to handle errors.

Please pay attention to the below: 

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "../utils/BlueBerryErrors.sol";

abstract contract BaseAdapter is Ownable {
    mapping(address => uint256) private _maxDelayTimes;

    event SetMaxDelayTime(address token, uint256 maxDelayTime);

    function setMaxDelayTime(address token, uint256 maxDelayTime) external onlyOwner {
        require(maxDelayTime <= 2 days, "Maximum delay time too long");
        require(maxDelayTime >= 10, "Maximum delay time too short");
        require(token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        _maxDelayTimes[token] = maxDelayTime;
        emit SetMaxDelayTime(token, maxDelayTime);
    }

    function getMaxDelayTime(address token) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(_maxDelayTimes[token] != 0, "Maximum delay time not set");
        return _maxDelayTimes[token];
    }
}

```
In the above updated code,
1.   `_maxDelayTimes` mapping is made private, and `getMaxDelayTime` function is added to allow authorized parties to read the maximum delay time for a given token , the `external` visibility modifier means that this function can be called by anyone outside the contract, but the `view` modifier indicates that this function only reads data and does not modify the state of the contract. 
2.  Added `require` keyword instead of `revert`.
