# Inflation and Deflation tokens not supported for vaults

## Summary
The bank contract add limitation for whitelist tokens, while the vaults seems not have these limitations, and is vulnerable to these tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail 
See below
## Impact
Taking `HardVault.sol` for example. When the token is inflated, user would lose their fund when withdrawing, since they can only withdraw the amount they deposited; when the token is deflated, the contract would loss fund and some user cannot withdraw their tokens, since they can still withdraw the same amount they deposited.
