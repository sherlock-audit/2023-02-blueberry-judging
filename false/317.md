# UniswapV2Oracle fails for pairs of token with more than 18 decimals

## Summary

The UniswapV2Oracle fails to get the price for pair of tokens that exceed 36 decimals together.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation for `getPrice` within the oracle uses `10**(36 - t0Decimal - t1Decimal)` to account for tokens having different decimals. This will underflow and revert if `t0Decimal + t1Decimal > 36` which could be the case for tokens using more than 18 decimals.

The protocol gives a list of "currently" supported tokens but seems to suggest that other tokens could be added in the future. We can imagine tokens with more than 18 decimals could be added and make the oracle fail.

## Impact

Tokens with more than 18 decimals cannot be added to use the UniswapV2Oracle. Depending on how the protocol evolve, it could be that these tokens are mistakenly added and use the UniswapV2Oracle, counting as 0 towards the value of debt or collateral of the users.

## Recommendation

Ensure tokens have less than 18 decimals when whitelisted in `BlueBerryBank.sol` or rethink calculation.
