# Users Won't Be Able To Withdraw Even If They Are Within The Withdraw Window

## Summary

Users Won't Be Able To Withdraw Even If They Are Within The Withdraw Window

## Vulnerability Detail

This is an edge case , In the withdraw function here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L103-L107 we check 
```solidity
block.timestamp <
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
                config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
```
, should be rather `if(block.timestamp <= config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow() )` 
because when `block.timestamp = config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() + config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow() ` (the user calls the withdraw at the final block allowed ) the user
is technically still inside the withdraw window (2 months) .
