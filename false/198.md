# Bind the oracle to pair instead Of Pair To Oracle

## Summary

Oracles are bound to the token instead of the pair

## Vulnerability detail

Oracles(TokenSettings) are mapped to the `token` but not to the specific pair. Pairs with the same `token` (e.g. UniswapV2 and Sushi) will be forced to use the same oracle. Generally this should be the expected behavior but there are also possibility that while adding a new pair changed the oracle of an older pair unexpectedly.

## Impact

Possibility that while adding a new pair changed the oracle of an older pair unexpectedly.

## Code Snippet

       `mapping(address => TokenSetting) public tokenSettings;`

## Tool Used

Manual investigation

## Recommendation

Bind the oracle to pair instead
