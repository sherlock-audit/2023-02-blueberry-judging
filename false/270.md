# AggregatorOracle allows for twice price deviation

## Summary

AggregatorOracle's `getPrice()` function allows for twice as much deviation for three sources than with two sources. This looks like unwanted behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function will revert line 127 if the two different prices from the valid sources differ by more than `maxPriceDeviation`. For three sources however, it will return the median price line 133 even if there is exactly `maxPriceDeviation` in between `prices[0]` and `prices[1]`, and `prices[1]` and `prices[2]`. Meaning there could be `maxPriceDeviation ** 2 / 1 e18` in between `prices[2]` and `prices[0]`.

I would expect that the sources should only be considered valid if they fall within `maxPriceDeviation` of each other.

## Impact

Possibly wrong price calculated for token using corrupted oracles. The price of tokens is used in multiple places in `BlueBerryBank.sol`, notably to determine whether a position is liquidatable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the square root of `maxPriceDeviation` for verifying deviation when treating three prices from oracles.
