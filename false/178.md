# Mints and Borrows are handled by seperate Accounts

## Summary
The `Softvault` is responsible for submitting the underlying collateral to the lending protocol, but the Bank contract asks for the borrows. Since these are two different accounts, borrows will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Lending protocol is described as a fork of the Compound protocol, with some listed changes. However none of these changes hint towards any change in the accounting system. The `SoftVault` contract handles the user's tokens and mints shares to represent that position.

The borrows, however, are handled by the bank, which is a different msg.sender as far as Compound is concerned, and thus runs a completely different account

The Bank account has no collateral deposited in the lending protocol, thus its borrow calls will revert.

This issue is difficult to confirm since the address of the bUSDC token in the `constants.ts` file is a proxy pointing to an unverified contract on etherscan. The severity of this issue has to be judged by the devs since the exact accounting mechanism is not clearly available.

## Impact
Borrows revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have both mints and borrows on the same contract, either the Bank or the SoftVault
