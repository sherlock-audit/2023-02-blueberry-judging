# BlueBerryBank cannot borrow

## Summary

`BlueBerryBank` does not call `enterMarkets` on the `Comptroller` contract to enter markets.

## Vulnerability Detail

With Compound, to borrow using cTokens as collateral, you must first call `enterMarkets` for those cTokens. When `addBank` is called in `BlueBerryBank`, the market for the associated cToken is not entered, preventing the new bank's holdings from being used as collateral.

The `IComptroller` interface is imported in `BlueBerryBank` but never used.
```solidity
interface IComptroller {
    function _setCreditLimit(
        address protocol,
        address market,
        uint256 creditLimit
    ) external;

    function enterMarkets(address[] memory cTokens)
        external
        returns (uint256[] memory);
}
```

## Impact

The underlying tokens deposited via `BlueBerryBank` can never be used as collateral for loans.

## Recommendation
