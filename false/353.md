# lower `maxDelay` boundary would DOS the protocol

## Summary
Setting `maxDelayTimes` for a token at the lowest possible value would DOS the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail

Every oracle checks the price fetched is fresh: that is, that it was received within a set `maxDelayTimes`

The issue is that `maxDelay` can be set as low as `10`.

As the block period on Ethereum is `12`, this means such a value would cause all the `getPrice` functions to revert - unless the function call happens in the same block as the oracle price update.


## Impact
The `getPrice` function reverting would lead to `IchiVaultSpell._validateMaxLTV()` reverting, making it impossible to open positions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a higher value for the lower boundary of `maxDelayTimes` to account for block period.
