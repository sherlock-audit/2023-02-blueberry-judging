# If an attacker were to set DENOMINATOR to zero or set config.withdrawVaultFee() to a value greater than DENOMINATOR

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/SoftVault.sol#L94-L119
The withdraw function calculates the fee deducted from the withdrawn amount using the formula `(withdrawAmount * config.withdrawVaultFee()) / DENOMINATOR`, where `DENOMINATOR` is a constant defined elsewhere, If `DENOMINATOR` is zero or `config.withdrawVaultFee()` is greater than `DENOMINATOR`, integer overflow or underflow can occur.

## Impact
If an attacker were to set `DENOMINATOR` to zero or set `config.withdrawVaultFee()` to a value greater than `DENOMINATOR`, an integer overflow or underflow would occur, resulting in an incorrect fee calculation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I will recommend adding a check to ensure that `config.withdrawVaultFee()` is less than or equal to `DENOMINATOR,` and also adding a check to ensure the `withdrawAmount` is less than or equal to the maximum value that can be represented by `uint256`.

Refer to this modification.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 shareAmount)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 withdrawAmount)
{
    if (shareAmount == 0) revert ZERO_AMOUNT();

    _burn(msg.sender, shareAmount);

    uint256 uBalanceBefore = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (cToken.redeem(shareAmount) != 0) revert REDEEM_FAILED(shareAmount);
    uint256 uBalanceAfter = uToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    if (config.withdrawVaultFee() > DENOMINATOR) revert INVALID_FEE();
    if (shareAmount > type(uint256).max / DENOMINATOR) revert OVERFLOW();

    uint256 withdrawAmountBeforeFee = uBalanceAfter - uBalanceBefore;
    uint256 fee = (withdrawAmountBeforeFee * config.withdrawVaultFee()) / DENOMINATOR;
    if (withdrawAmountBeforeFee < fee) revert UNDERFLOW();
    withdrawAmount = withdrawAmountBeforeFee - fee;

    // Cut withdraw fee if it is in withdrawVaultFee Window (2 months)
    if (
        block.timestamp <
        config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
    ) {
        uToken.safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
    }
    uToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, withdrawAmount);

    emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, withdrawAmount, shareAmount);
}
```
Then Next calculate the `withdrawAmountBeforeFee` as the difference between the `uBalanceAfter` and `uBalanceBefore` which is the amount of underlying assets withdrawn before the fee is deducted. 
We then calculate the fee as `(withdrawAmountBeforeFee * config.withdrawVaultFee()) / DENOMINATOR`.
We check that `withdrawAmountBeforeFee` is greater than or equal to `fee` to avoid underflow.
