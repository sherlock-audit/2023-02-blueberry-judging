# everyone CAN Trigger interest accrual for banks and utokens

## Summary
everyone CAN Trigger interest accrual for banks and utokens

## Vulnerability Detail
 **Lack of access control** in BlueBerryBank.sol#``accrue()`` anyone can do it in any moment they want

## Impact
will cause unwanted accrual in interests and in false risky timing for certain utokens which is **not acceptable**

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function accrue(address token) public override {
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (!bank.isListed) revert BANK_NOT_LISTED(token);
        bank.totalDebt = ICErc20(bank.cToken).borrowBalanceCurrent(
            address(this)
        );
    }
```
