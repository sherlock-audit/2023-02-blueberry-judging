# User can Loss Funds because of `burn` logic of `WERC20` if ERC20 Token used is `Rabase Token`

## Summary

Use of Rebase Tokens can lead to fund loss to user and contract will lock that excess fund forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holderâ€™s balanceof() increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens. If such tokens are used during mint then the amount of wrapped tokens will be `x` at the time of minting. But over time, it can increase from `x` to `x + y` but during burn, user will only be able to claim `x` tokens leaving `y` forever in the contract.

## Impact

If rebasing tokens are used as the underlying token, rewards accrue to the contract and cannot be withdrawn by either the contract or the user, and remain locked forever.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: WERC20.sol

    function mint(address token, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
    {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        _mint(
            msg.sender,
            uint256(uint160(token)),
            balanceAfter - balanceBefore,
            ""
        );
    }

    function burn(address token, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
    {
        _burn(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(token)), amount);
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

## Recommendation

Track total amounts currently deposited and allow users to withdraw excess on a pro-rata basis.
