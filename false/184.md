# cToken has no white list limit

## Summary
In the `addBank()` in Blueberrybank, there is a restriction on Token, which only allows to be added in the whitelist. But there is no restriction on cToken and can be any token.

## Vulnerability Detail
If you all trust the administrator's operation, then token does not need to be restricted. Now that the Token is checked, it is also useful to check cToken. For example, token and cToken will appear as the same tokens, or cToken is a tokens that do not meet the requirements.
## Impact
cToken has no white list limit
