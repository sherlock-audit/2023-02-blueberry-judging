# No Functionality To Send Eth From WERC20

## Summary

The receive function here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L141 expects ether sent from the WERC20.sol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/wrapper/WERC20.sol , but their is no functionality to send ether from the WERC20 contract.


## Vulnerability Detail

The BasicSpell needs eth to be a foundational block for other spells , and it expects eth from the WERC20 contract as stated here
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L140
But there is no functionality (no transfer/call/send ) to send ether from the WERC20 to the BasicSpell Contract.
## Impact

There  would be no ether sent from the WERC20 to the BasicSpell rendering the functionality useless.

Add a functionality in the WERC20 contract to send ether to the BasicSpell contract
