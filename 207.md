# latestRoundData() has no check for round completeness

## Summary

Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` might return stale results.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RoundId` is the identifier of the new returned price every round. Ensure that every Chainlink's price retrieval has a new `roundId` otherwise we are querying the stale price.

## Impact

`latestRoundData()` might return stale results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `roundId` check. Change from this:

```solidity
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
```
to this:

```solidity
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(
         token,
         USD
        ); 
        
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
```
