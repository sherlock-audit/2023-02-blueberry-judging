# Input Validation in setDepositFee() and setWithdrawFee() functions.

## Summary
`setDepositFee()` and `setWithdrawFee()` functions do not check if the input values exceed the maximum allowed value of 20%.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract owner is to set the deposit and withdraw fees to excessively high values, beyond the capped limit of 20% (2000 basis points). 

`setDepositFee()` and `setWithdrawFee()` functions contain a check to cap the fees to 20%, but the check is not applied when the fees are initialized in the `initialize()` function. 

This simply means that if the contract owner does not call the `setDepositFee()` and `setWithdrawFee()` functions to set the fees to appropriate values, the default fees of 0.5% (50 basis points) could be exploited and overridden with excessively high values, and this could result in users being charged exorbitant fees for depositing and withdrawing funds, leading to loss of funds and lead them loss trust in the system.

Another thing is, if the contract owner sets high fees, they can potentially earn significant profits at the expense of their users, in this case it is important to ensure that the initial default fees are set to reasonable values and/or the initialization function is updated to include the same check as the `setDepositFee()` and `setWithdrawFee()` functions.

## Impact
An attacker if gains access to the vulnerability, could set the `deposit` and `withdraw` fees to an arbitrary amount greater than 20%, which could be detrimental to the users who interact with the contract. 
This could also lead to users paying higher fees than expected and may discourage users from using the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement input validation to check if the input values exceed the maximum allowed value of 20%.

1. The `setDepositFee()` and `setWithdrawFee()` functions should be modified to include an input validation check.
Modified to include an input validation check.
```solidity
function setDepositFee(uint256 depositFee_) external onlyOwner {
    require(depositFee_ <= 2000, "Deposit fee cannot exceed 20%");
    depositFee = depositFee_;
}
```

2. And also similar to the `setWithdrawFee()` function can also be modified to include an input validation check:
```solidity
function setWithdrawFee(uint256 withdrawFee_) external onlyOwner {
    require(withdrawFee_ <= 2000, "Withdraw fee cannot exceed 20%");
    withdrawFee = withdrawFee_;
}
```
