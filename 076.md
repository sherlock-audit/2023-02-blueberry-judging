# No ability to provide slippage when closing position

## Summary
No ability to provide slippage when closing position, as result user can receive dust for swapping
## Vulnerability Detail
When user closes position in IchiVaultSpell, then he withdraws some amount of tokens from ichi vault.
In that moment contract receives some portion of 2 tokens(borrow token and any other token) and contract swaps second one to borrow token using uniswap.

```solidity
        bool isTokenA = vault.token0() == borrowToken;
        uint256 amountToSwap = IERC20(
            isTokenA ? vault.token1() : vault.token0()
        ).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amountToSwap > 0) {
            swapPool = IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool());
            swapPool.swap(
                address(this),
                // if withdraw token is Token0, then swap token1 -> token0 (false)
                !isTokenA,
                int256(amountToSwap),
                isTokenA
                    ? UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1 // Token0 -> Token1
                    : UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1, // Token1 -> Token0
                abi.encode(address(this))
            );
        }
```

Currently `sqrtPriceLimitX96` is set as UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1 or UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1. User doesn't have ability to provide his own slippage and as result he can't be protected from price jumping.

So it's possible that after withdrawing from ichi vault, token that is needed to be swapped will be swapped for dust amount.
## Impact
User loses funds as he can't protect himself from price changes.

## Recommendation
Add ability to provide `sqrtPriceLimitX96` param to user.
