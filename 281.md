# `safeApprove()` should approve 0 first

## Summary
Some tokens (e.g. USDT) don't work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by 0 and then the actual allowance must be approved.

Additionally, use of `safeApprove()` is not recommended, [as it is deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/566a774222707e424896c0c390a84dc3c13bdcb2/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L37-L43).

As documented above the `safeApprove()` function:

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
     * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
     *
     * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
     * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
     */
```

Instead of using `safeApprove()`, OpenZeppelin recommends that:
> Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions using `safeApprove()` should be approved by zero first. Additionally, using `{safeIncreaseAllowance}` and `{safeDecreaseAllowance}` is considered best practice.

## Impact
When trying to re-approve an already approved token, all transactions revert and the protocol cannot be used. Also, it is bad practice to use a deprecated function.

## Code Snippet
There are 4 instances of `safeApprove()` being used:

## Recommendation
Approve with a zero amount first before setting the actual amount. 

Additionally, consider using `{safeIncreaseAllowance}` and `{safeDecreaseAllowance}`
