# The total lent amount of a bank is not decremented when a position is liquidated

## Summary

When a position is (partially) liquidated, and the debt is repaid, the `Bank.totalLend` variable is not decremented. This can lead to inaccuracies in the total amount of funds lent out by the bank. Over time, the more positions are liquidated, the more the `Bank.totalLend` variable will be off.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Bank.totalLend` variable in the `BlueBerryBank` contract tracks the total amount of funds lent out by a given ERC-20 token bank. This value is adjusted whenever funds are lent out or withdrawn. However, when a position is (partially) liquidated, the debt is repaid, but the `totalLend` variable is not decremented.

While the position to be liquidated has its debt repaid and the `Position.collateralSize`, `Position.underlyingAmount` and `Position.underlyingVaultShare` variables decremented, `Bank.totalLend` remains unchanged and is therefore stale.

## Impact

The value of `bank.totalLend` is stale and does not accurately reflect the actual amount of tokens lent to the bank. This could lead to issues later in the future if the `BlueBerryBank` contract gets upgraded and needs to rely on the correct value of `bank.totalLend`.

## Code Snippet

[BlueBerryBank.sol#L534](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L534)

```solidity
511: function liquidate(
512:     uint256 positionId,
513:     address debtToken,
514:     uint256 amountCall
515: ) external override lock poke(debtToken) {
516:     if (amountCall == 0) revert ZERO_AMOUNT();
517:     if (!isLiquidatable(positionId)) revert NOT_LIQUIDATABLE(positionId);
518:     Position storage pos = positions[positionId];
519:     Bank memory bank = banks[pos.underlyingToken];
520:     if (pos.collToken == address(0)) revert BAD_COLLATERAL(positionId);
521:
522:     uint256 oldShare = pos.debtShareOf[debtToken];
523:     (uint256 amountPaid, uint256 share) = repayInternal(
524:         positionId,
525:         debtToken,
526:         amountCall
527:     );
528:
529:     uint256 liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) / oldShare;
530:     uint256 uTokenSize = (pos.underlyingAmount * share) / oldShare;
531:     uint256 uVaultShare = (pos.underlyingVaultShare * share) / oldShare;
532:
533:     pos.collateralSize -= liqSize;
534:     pos.underlyingAmount -= uTokenSize; // @audit-info `bank.totalLend` is not decremented by `uTokenSize` - it's stale
535:     pos.underlyingVaultShare -= uVaultShare;
536:
...      // [...]
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider deducting `uTokenSize` from `bank.totalLend` in the `BlueBerryBank.liquidate` function to prevent stale values.
