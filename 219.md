# Approval race condition in BasicSpell.sol (DOS)

## Summary
The ensureApprove() function can potentially create an approval race condition.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check to make sure doRepay() function can only be called after ensureApprove() function has confirmed the approval.
The ensureApprove() function can potentially create an approval race condition, where a user could call the doRepay() function, which would call ensureApprove() with the approval not yet being confirmed. If the user immediately calls the repay() function of the Bank contract before the approval has been confirmed, the transaction could fail.

## Impact
When someone wants to repay tokens to the Bank on behalf of the current executor by calling doRepay() the transaction might fail because there is no check to ensure that ensureApprove() has already confirmed the approval before doRefund() was called.

## Recommendation
To fix this, i recommend adding a modifier to ensure that the doRepay() function can only be called after the ensureApprove() function has confirmed the approval.
