# ICHI Vault LP tokens cannot be withdrawn

## Summary

If `closePosition`/`closePositionFarm` is called with a non-zero `amountLpWithdraw`, ICHI Vault LP tokens are not transferred to the executor and left in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `withdrawInternal`, the `amountLpWithdraw` is set aside and not used to withdraw liquidity from the vault.
```solidity
        // 2. Calculate actual amount to remove
        uint256 amtLPToRemove = vault.balanceOf(address(this)) - amountLpWithdraw;

        // 3. Withdraw liquidity from ICHI vault
        vault.withdraw(amtLPToRemove, address(this));
```
However, they are never sent to the user. Only `borrowToken` and `collToken` are sent to the executor as the function continues.
```solidity
        // 7. Refund
        doRefund(borrowToken);
        doRefund(collToken);
```

## Impact

The ICHI Vault LP tokens remain in the `IchiVaultSpell` contract and will later be included in the next open/close position of the same strategy. An attacker could watch for transactions sent to close positions with a non-zero `amountLpWithdraw` and immediately take the tokens with a follow-up transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a refund of the vault LP token at the end of the `withdrawInternal` function.
```solidity
        // 7. Refund
        doRefund(borrowToken);
        doRefund(collToken);
        doRefund(vault);
```
