# lack of deadline for uniswap pool transaction allows swap to be done unfavourably

## Summary
When closing a position in `IchiVaultSpell`, `withdrawInternal` is called which allows user to swap borrowed tokens into initial deposit tokens. However, a low level uniswap `swap` is used to do the swap which does not have a deadline check. The lack of deadline check enables pending transactions to be executed at a later point where the price might have changed drastically.

## Vulnerability Detail

In step 4 of `withdrawInternal`, notice the `swap` function called on the uniswap pool itself. This is a low level function that omits the deadline check unlike higher level functions like swapExactInputSingle or swapExactOutputSingle that includes it.

```solidity
        // 4. Swap withdrawn tokens to initial deposit token
        bool isTokenA = vault.token0() == borrowToken;
        uint256 amountToSwap = IERC20(
            isTokenA ? vault.token1() : vault.token0()
        ).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amountToSwap > 0) {
            swapPool = IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool());
            swapPool.swap(
                address(this),
                // if withdraw token is Token0, then swap token1 -> token0 (false)
                !isTokenA,
                int256(amountToSwap),
                isTokenA
                    ? UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1 // Token0 -> Token1
                    : UniV3WrappedLibMockup.MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1, // Token1 -> Token0
                abi.encode(address(this))
            );
        }

```
This enables user to perform bad trades. User trades will not be timebound, allowing it to go into hours or days where the price of the pool might have changed drastically. Even if the slippage control (sqrtPriceLimitX96) is not hardcoded to 0 (will be mentioned in another bug finding), the `sqrtPriceLimitX96` might be outdated and does not reflect the present market conditions.




## Impact

User's trade can be executed at an unfavourable market time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

AMM like uniswap V3 have implemented deadline check in their `swapExactInputSingle`. Recommend implementing the `deadline` check like how uniswap does it.

```solidity
    function exactInput(ExactInputParams memory params)
        external
        payable
        override
        checkDeadline(params.deadline)
        returns (uint256 amountOut)
``` 
```solidity
    modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Transaction too old');
        _;
    }
```
