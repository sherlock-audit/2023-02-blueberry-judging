# Underlying tokens can be locked in `BlueBerryBank` after `withdrawLend`



## Summary
Underlying tokens can be locked in `BlueBerryBank` after `withdrawLend`, and it will cause fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the owner of a position wants to withdraw underlying tokens using `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend`, he withdraws from a vault of current bank. `BlueBerryBank` will receive `wAmount` of underlying token.
```solidity
        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }
```
 But `wAmount` can be larger than `pos.underlyingAmount` especially when using a soft vault. If `wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount`, `wAmount` will be capped by `pos.underlyingAmount`.
```solidity
        wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
            ? pos.underlyingAmount
            : wAmount;
```
After that, BlueBerryBank send some underlying tokens to treasury and the rest to msg.sender(Spell), and the total amount will be `wAmount` before Line 701.
```solidity
        wAmount = doCutWithdrawFee(token, wAmount);

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
```
```solidity
    function doCutWithdrawFee(address token, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (config.treasury() == address(0)) revert NO_TREASURY_SET();
        uint256 fee = (amount * config.withdrawFee()) / DENOMINATOR;
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
        return amount - fee;
    }
```

But the `wAmount` before Line 701 is capped by `pos.underlyingAmount`, so it will be `pos.underlyingAmount` and less than the original `wAmount` if the original `wAmount` from current vault is larger than `pos.underlyingAmount`. And original `wAmount` - `pos.underlyingAmount` of underlying tokens will be locked in `BlueBerryBank`. And there is no sweep mechanism in Bank contract, so those amount will be locked forever and it causes fund loss.

## Impact
Some underlying tokens will be locked in Bank contract, and it causes fund loss.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add sweep mechanism for the locked funds, or send rest amount to treasury, or send to the owner of the position.
