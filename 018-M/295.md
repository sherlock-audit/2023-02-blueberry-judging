# Missing transaction expiration check in `withdrawInternal`

## Summary
The `withdrawInternal` function swaps tokens in a Uniswap V3 pool, however there's no transaction expiration check. Users may sell tokens at an outdated price and lose some funds to MEV bots.
## Vulnerability Detail
When closing a position, [LP tokens are removed from the ICHI vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L297-L298), and the contract receives two token: one is the borrow token, and the other is the other token of the vault. The second token is then [sold for the borrow token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L307-L316), and the entire amount of the borrow token is then [used to repay user's debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L323). However, the swapping operation is not protected from a positive price change: if the price of the borrow token has decreased, the swap will still be executed at the price at the moment the transaction was created. This makes the swap more profitable to MEV bots:
1. a bot may manipulate the price of the token to bring it to the value at which the transaction was created;
1. the swap will the be performed at a higher price;
1. the MEV bot will be able to get the difference + the slippage tolerance (which is controlled by the `amountLpWithdraw` parameter).

Swapping is generally sensitive to the price: users always want to swap tokens at the current price, or a price that's not very outdated. However, transactions may take longer to be mined (due to suddenly increased gas price) or pool prices can be manipulated via flash loans. There are two ways how these events can be mitigated:
1. negative price changes (i.e. an increase of the price of the token being bought) are protected by a slippage tolerance checks (slippage tolerance is controlled by the `amountLpWithdraw` parameter);
1. positive price changes (i.e. an decrease of the price of the token being bought) are protected by a transaction expiration check.

Currently, there's no transaction expiration check in the "close position" operation. If a user's transaction gets stuck in the mempool due to increased gas prices, they're risking swapping tokens at a price that's lower than the current price (if the price has grown since the transaction was sent). The transaction will be executed successfully and debt will be repaid as expected, however the amount of LP tokens required for the repayment will be bigger due to the change price.
## Impact
Due to a missing transaction expiration check in the "close position" operation (which involves swapping of tokens), users may sell more LP tokens than required to repay their debt.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider adding a transaction expiration check to the `closePosition` and `closePositionFarm` functions of the `IchiVaultSpell` contract:
1. callers of the functions need to specify a deadline argument, which is a timestamp at which the transaction expires;
1. the functions need to check the deadline argument value against the timestamp of the block when the transaction is executed: if the deadline is in the past, the transaction needs to be reverted.
