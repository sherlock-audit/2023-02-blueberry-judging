# ICHI rewards are lost if user calls openPositionFarm for the second time

## Summary

ICHI rewards are lost if user calls `openPositionFarm` for the second time

## Vulnerability Detail

If user has an open position, then wIchiFarm tokens are burned

```solidity
if (collSize > 0) {
    (uint256 decodedPid, ) = wIchiFarm.decodeId(collId);
    if (farmingPid != decodedPid) revert INCORRECT_PID(farmingPid);
    if (posCollToken != address(wIchiFarm))
        revert INCORRECT_COLTOKEN(posCollToken);
    bank.takeCollateral(collSize);
    wIchiFarm.burn(collId, collSize);
}
```

In that burn function, the reward ICHI is transferred to the sender - `IchiVaultSpell`.

```solidity
if (enIchi > stIchi) {
    ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, enIchi - stIchi);
}
```

IchiVaultSpell does not have accounting for ICHI tokens. Therefore the reward is lost for the position. The tokens will be stolen on next `depositInternal` by random user who calls with borrowToken=ICHI

```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(borrowToken).balanceOf(address(this));
vault.deposit(balance, 0, address(this));
```

Adversary can observe the mempool for above mentioned transaction and transfer the rewards to herself via borrowing ICHI token.

## Impact

Users farm rewards are lost.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (enIchi > stIchi) {
    ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, enIchi - stIchi);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Send the ICHI rewards to the position owner after burning the farm tokens. This can be done by calling `doRefund(ICHI)`
