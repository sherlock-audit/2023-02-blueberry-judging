# Front-running liquidator that use type(uint256).max

## Summary

Users with liquidatable positions can front-run someone trying to liquidate them by updating their position to re-collateralise them and borrow sufficiently to be on the verge of liquidation. They can hope that when the liquidator's transaction is applied, with the oracle price updates, they are once again illegible to liquidation and the liquidator has to repay more than they first anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail

A liquidation is basically a trade (or swap) of debt token for vault share + wrapped lp token. If a liquidator uses `type(uint256).max` as the `amountCall`, they basically accept any condition for the trade, which we know is bad.

This behaviour seems encouraged as can be seen in [the tests](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/test/bank.test.ts#L195) or in [the repay function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L771).

If the owner of the position executes `IchiVaultSpell.openPosition()` on the position to add collateral and borrow enough to be on the verge of liquidation, it could be that when the liquidator's transaction executes they will have to repay that increased amount of collateral or receive a lower amount of vault share + wrapped lp token than expected.

To prevent such cases, we usually see protocols implement require users to provide expected amount received. In this case the liquidator should provide `expectedLiqSize` and / or `expectedVaultShare` to make sure they receive the right amount, and they should never use `type(uint256).max` as `amountCall`.

## Impact

Liquidator may repay unexpected amount of debt.

## Code Snippet

liquidate takes `amountCall` input and attempts to fully repay it:

repayInternal uses `type(uint256).max` to fully repay a debt without further checks:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Get expected received amount of share / token as input of `liquidate()` disencourage using `type(uint256).max`
