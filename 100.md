# In case if deposit or withdraw fee is 0, protocol will not work properly with tokens thar doesn't support 0 amount transfer

## Summary
In case if deposit or withdraw fee is 0, protocol will not work properly with tokens thar dosn't support 0 amount transfer.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function doCutDepositFee(address token, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (config.treasury() == address(0)) revert NO_TREASURY_SET();
        uint256 fee = (amount * config.depositFee()) / DENOMINATOR;
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
        return amount - fee;
    }
```
In case if fee is 0 and token do not allow 0 amount transfers, this code will revert.
## Impact
Protocol will not work properly with tokens thar doesn't support 0 amount transfer.
