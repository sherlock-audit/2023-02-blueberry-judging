# Used Depreciated `safeApprove` + For some tokens that don't support approve `type(uint256).max` amount it will not work.

## Summary

Use of `safeApprove` has been depreciated and not recommeded to use. For some tokens that don't support approve `type(uint256).max` amount it will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are tokens that doesn't support approve spender type(uint256).max amount. So the `safeApprove` will not work for some tokens like `UNI` or `COMP` who will revert when approve type(uint256).max amount.

## Impact

Tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount could not be transferred.
