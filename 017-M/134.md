# If borrower got blacklisted by asset contract their collateral can be permanently frozen by bank

## Summary
If borrower got blacklisted by asset contract their collateral can be permanently frozen by bank.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user wants to withdraw some collateral he can call `IchiVaultSpell.reducePosition` function.
It will first [withdraw collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L271) from bank to the spell and then [refund it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/BasicSpell.sol#L59) to the executor, who is the [position owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L121).

If during duration of loan borrower will be blacklisted by collateral asset, for example USDC, then there is no way to get collateral back for him. These collateral funds will be permanently locked at the bank.
## Impact
Borrower's collateral is permanently frozen by bank.
