# Chainlink's reported `answer` can be being carried over and stale

## Summary
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values mentions: "You can check `answeredInRound` against the current `roundId`. If `answeredInRound` is less than `roundId`, the answer is being carried over. If `answeredInRound` is equal to `roundId`, then the answer is fresh." However, the `ChainlinkAdapterOracle.getPrice` function, which is shown in the Code Snippet section, does not check `answeredInRound` against the current `roundId`, where `answeredInRound` and `roundId` are returned by the `registry.latestRoundData` function call. This can lead to unreliable reported price based on the Chainlink's reported `answer` that is being carried over and stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calling the `ChainlinkAdapterOracle.getPrice` function executes `if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime) revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token)`, where `maxDelayTime` is configured for the token. Although this ensures that the Chainlink's reported `answer` is relatively new based on the configured `maxDelayTime`, it does not guarantee that such reported `answer` is not being carried over and not stale.

## Impact
When the Chainlink's reported `answer` is being carried over and stale, such `answer` is not reliable. Using the reported price based on such unreliable `answer` can cause critical user actions, such as lending, withdrawing, borrowing, repaying, and liquidating, that should be disallowed to be allowed, or vice versa.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkAdapterOracle.sol#L66-L84
```solidity
    function getPrice(address _token) external view override returns (uint256) {
        // remap token if possible
        address token = remappedTokens[_token];
        if (token == address(0)) token = _token;

        uint256 maxDelayTime = maxDelayTimes[token];
        if (maxDelayTime == 0) revert NO_MAX_DELAY(_token);

        // try to get token-USD price
        uint256 decimals = registry.decimals(token, USD);
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);

        return (answer.toUint256() * 1e18) / 10**decimals;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `ChainlinkAdapterOracle.getPrice` function can be updated to resemble the following code.

```solidity
    function getPrice(address _token) external view override returns (uint256) {
        ...

        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );

        require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "answer is stale");

        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);

        ...
    }
```
