# Med: Anyone can call initialize() of the implementation contract

## Summary
Anyone can call initialize() of various implementation contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function of the following implementation contracts can be triggered by any account:

https://github.com/PwnedNoMore-DAO/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/SoftVault.sol#L41
https://github.com/PwnedNoMore-DAO/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L94
https://github.com/PwnedNoMore-DAO/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/ProtocolConfig.sol#L28

## Impact
An attacker can get the ownership of those implementation contracts.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized (see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L51)
