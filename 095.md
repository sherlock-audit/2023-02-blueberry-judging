# Possible DOS in `getPositionIdsByOwner()` function because of unbounded gas consumption

## Summary

In the `BlueBerryBank.sol` contract `getPositionIdsByOwner`  function is declared which returns the position ids of the position owner. We can only get this list of ids from the `getPositionIdsByOwner` view function.  There is no option to remove this ids from this array.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
This function fetched all elements of the list from storage, which is really gas-consuming and even can break the block gas limit in case the list is too large. Even though users donâ€™t need to pay gas for the view function, this function is still failed if its gas cost larger than the block gas limit.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L315-L333
```solidity
function getPositionIdsByOwner(address owner)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256[] memory ids)
    {
        uint256[] memory matchingIds = new uint256[](nextPositionId);
        uint256 index;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nextPositionId; i++) {
            if (positions[i].owner == owner) {
                matchingIds[index] = i;
                index++;
            }
        }

        ids = new uint256[](index);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            ids[i] = matchingIds[i];
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function `getPositionIdsByOwner` should return an array in range.
```solidity
function getPositionIdsByOwner(address owner, unit range) external view returns (uint256[] memory ids)
{
......
}
```
