# In case if user withdrawLend in withdrawVaultFee window, his position.underlyingAmount is not updated correctly

## Summary
In case if user withdrawLend in withdrawVaultFee window, his position.underlyingAmount is not updated correctly as result he can borrow more then he has collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
Amount that user can borrow [depends on position.underlyingAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L109-L112). The more underlyingAmount is, more amount user can borrow.

When user lends to bank, this amount [is increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L643-L644). Then underlying token is [deposited to the soft or hard vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L646-L657).

Later, user can `withdrawLend` and receive collateral he provided.

```solidity
    function withdrawLend(address token, uint256 shareAmount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
    {
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (token != pos.underlyingToken) revert INVALID_UTOKEN(token);
        if (shareAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            shareAmount = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
        }


        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }


        wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
            ? pos.underlyingAmount
            : wAmount;


        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;
        pos.underlyingAmount -= wAmount;
        bank.totalLend -= wAmount;


        wAmount = doCutWithdrawFee(token, wAmount);


        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
    }
```
In this case, `shareAmount` will be withdrawn from soft or hard vault and then `pos.underlyingVaultShare` will be decreased by `shareAmount` and `pos.underlyingAmount` will be decreased by `wAmount` which is amount of underlying tokens returned by vault.

In case if withdraw happens in `withdrawVaultFee window`, then soft vault and hard vault [cut fee for that](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/SoftVault.sol#L110-L119).
In that case `shareAmount` that was provided to vault withdraw function will not be equal to `wAmount`, returned by function.

However, `pos.underlyingAmount` is decreased by `wAmount` and this is incorrect as it should be decreased by `shareAmount`.
As result user can't withdraw that additional amount, but can use it in order to borrow.

Example.
1.User deposited 100 usdc as collateral and he can borrow 500$ worth of another asset through bank.
2.In `withdrawVaultFee window` user wants to withdraw 100 usdc and fee was collected, so he received 80 usdc.
3.`pos.underlyingAmount` was not set to 0, it's 20 now, so user is able to get 100# worth of debt now, however he doesn't have any collateral anymore.
## Impact
`pos.underlyingAmount` is not updated correctly, so user can still borrow using amount that he paid for fees.

## Recommendation
You need to update position using `shareAmount`.
```
        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;
        pos.underlyingAmount -= shareAmount;
        bank.totalLend -= shareAmount;
 ```
