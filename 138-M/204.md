# `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function cannot be paused

## Summary
When an extreme market condition occurs, the protocol faces an exploit, or the authority issues a legal requirement, the protocol is able to pause the lending, borrowing, and repaying functionalities. However, the protocol is unable to pause the functionality for reducing a position.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because the `BlueBerryBank` contract does not have a function, which is like `BlueBerryBank.isBorrowAllowed`, `BlueBerryBank.isRepayAllowed`, and `BlueBerryBank.isLendAllowed`, for pausing the functionality for reducing a position, the `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function, which is shown in the Code Snippet section, cannot be paused. Users can still call the `IchiVaultSpell.reducePosition` function that further calls the `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function to reduce a position when there is a need for pausing this functionality.

## Impact
Just like pausing the lending, borrowing, and repaying functionalities, it is possible that the protocol needs to pause the functionality for reducing a position. However, when this need occurs, users can still reduce their positions through calling the `IchiVaultSpell.reducePosition` and `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` functions. The protocol cannot stop the outflow of the funds due to these position reductions even it is required to do so in this situation.

```solidity
    function reducePosition(
        uint256 strategyId,
        address collToken,
        uint256 collAmount
    ) external {
        doWithdraw(collToken, collAmount);
        doRefund(collToken);
        _validateMaxLTV(strategyId);
    }
```

```solidity
    function withdrawLend(address token, uint256 shareAmount)
        external
        override
        inExec
        poke(token)
    {
        Position storage pos = positions[POSITION_ID];
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        if (token != pos.underlyingToken) revert INVALID_UTOKEN(token);
        if (shareAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            shareAmount = pos.underlyingVaultShare;
        }

        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
            wAmount = IHardVault(bank.hardVault).withdraw(token, shareAmount);
        }

        wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
            ? pos.underlyingAmount
            : wAmount;

        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= shareAmount;
        pos.underlyingAmount -= wAmount;
        bank.totalLend -= wAmount;

        wAmount = doCutWithdrawFee(token, wAmount);

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A function, which is similar to the `BlueBerryBank.isBorrowAllowed`, `BlueBerryBank.isRepayAllowed`, and `BlueBerryBank.isLendAllowed` functions, can be added in the `BlueBerryBank` contract for pausing the `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function. This function can then be used in the `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function so the `BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend` function can be paused when needed.
