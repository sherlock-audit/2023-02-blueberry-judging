# Wrong formula is used in IchiLpOracle to calculate the price of LP tokens, the price can be manipulated.

## Summary

The protocol uses wrong formula to calculate the price of LP tokens. This can lead to price manipulation of the LP tokens and would return wrong value of position risk and hence  wrong value about if a loan is liquidable.

## Vulnerability Detail

> Note : This is very similar to how warp finance was [[attacked](https://rekt.news/warp-finance-rekt/)](https://rekt.news/warp-finance-rekt/) .
> 

In `IchiLpOracle` the function `getPrice` returns the price of LP tokens in USD. This function is using the following formula to calculate the LP token price:

Price = TotalReserve / totalSupply

Where TotalReserve is calculated as follows:

TotalReserve = (reserve0 * price0) + (reserve1 * price1)

The value of TotalReserve can be manipulated by an attacker using a flashloan for example:

1. Take a huge flash loan.
2. Use some part of the flash loan to provide liquidity on the pair on ichi and receive the LP tokens.
3. Use the remainder of the flash loan to swap for example in USDC <> ICHI pool , this will change the totalreserves and hence the price of LP calculated will be changed.
4. Use the LP we received in step 2 as collateral on blueberry.
5. Borrow all the assets we can using the collateral at the inflated price of LP tokens caculated because of the manipulation at step 3.
6. Repay the flash loan and let the blueberry loan go bust.

## Impact

The protocol can be drained.

```solidity

        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        address token0 = vault.token0();
        address token1 = vault.token1();

        (uint256 r0, uint256 r1) = vault.getTotalAmounts();
        uint256 px0 = base.getPrice(address(token0));
        uint256 px1 = base.getPrice(address(token1));
        uint256 t0Decimal = IERC20Metadata(token0).decimals();
        uint256 t1Decimal = IERC20Metadata(token1).decimals();

        uint256 totalReserve = (r0 * px0) /
            10**t0Decimal +
            (r1 * px1) /
            10**t1Decimal;

        return (totalReserve * 1e18) / totalSupply;
    }
