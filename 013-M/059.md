# DOS attack to getPositionIdsByOwner()

## Summary
DOS attack to ``getPositionIdsByOwner()``. The main problem is that it iterate through all positions, so when ``nextPositionId``, the function will run out of gas.


## Vulnerability Detail
The ``getPositionIdsByOwner()`` function needs to iterate though all positions to find the position for a particular owner.

The number of iterations is determined by the total positions, ``nextPositionId``.

Any attacker Bob can call ``execute()`` repeatedly with argument ``positionId = 0``, either to lend or borrow a small amount, to inflate the total number of positions in the protocol, ``nextPositionId``.

As a result, future call of the ``getPositionIdsByOwner()`` function will run out of gas. A DOS attack.


## Impact
A DOS attack to ``getPositionIdsByOwner()``.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create an index for each owner's positions so that there is no need to iterate though the whole position list to find the positions for the owner.
