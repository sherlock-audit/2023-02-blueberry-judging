# max position size of strategy can be bypassed if oracle returns 0

## Summary
When depositing asset in ICHI Vault in IchiVaultSpell, position size is checked against the strategy maxPositionSize parameter to make sure it does not exceed the maximum allowed. However, the current Position Size uses value received from oracle to calculate and hence a price of 0 returned by any oracle that is associated with the bank will result in the maximum position size check to be bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail

`depositInternal` in `IchiVaultSpell` is called by `openPosition` and `openPositionFarm` to deposit asset in ICHI Vault. At the end of the function step 5, notice that the position size is checked against the maximum position size of the strategy. 

`lpPrice` will be 0 in the event the oracle attached to the bank returns 0 which will result in `curPosSize` being 0. The check will be bypassed if `curPosSize` is 0.

```solidity
    function depositInternal(
        uint256 strategyId,
        address collToken,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 collAmount,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) internal {
        Strategy memory strategy = strategies[strategyId];

        // 1. Lend isolated collaterals on compound
        doLend(collToken, collAmount);

        // 2. Borrow specific amounts
        doBorrow(borrowToken, borrowAmount);

        // 3. Add liquidity - Deposit on ICHI Vault
        IICHIVault vault = IICHIVault(strategy.vault);
        bool isTokenA = vault.token0() == borrowToken;
        uint256 balance = IERC20(borrowToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        ensureApprove(borrowToken, address(vault));
        if (isTokenA) {
            vault.deposit(balance, 0, address(this));
        } else {
            vault.deposit(0, balance, address(this));
        }

        // 4. Validate MAX LTV
        _validateMaxLTV(strategyId);

        // 5. Validate Max Pos Size
        uint256 lpPrice = bank.oracle().getPrice(strategy.vault);
        uint256 curPosSize = (lpPrice * vault.balanceOf(address(this))) /
            10**IICHIVault(strategy.vault).decimals();
        if (curPosSize > strategy.maxPositionSize)
            revert EXCEED_MAX_POS_SIZE(strategyId);
    }

```



## Impact
User can open position size that exceeds the strategy position size, ignoring the risk parameters that are placed on position size by the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend doing a check on the returned lpPrice to make sure that it is more than 0. As other oracle might be used, I think that ensuring the lpPrice returned is correct is safer than expecting all oracles used now and added in the future to not return 0.
 
```solidity
 if (lpPrice <= 0){
    revert ORACLE_PRICE_ERROR(strategyId);
}
            
```
