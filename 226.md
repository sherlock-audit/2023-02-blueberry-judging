# Initializers in implementation contracts not disabled

## Summary
It is possible to call `initialize` on the implementation contracts deployed by the project.

## Vulnerability Detail

Upgradeable contracts are currently no disabling the initializers per OZ recommendation and therefore leaving the implementation contracts open to a malicious actor to initialize.

## Impact

While it seems it's currently no resulting in a financial loss, it's possible future updates might introduce a way to harm the project financially. It is possible to cause confusion by polluting the blockchain logs.

### POC

Demonstrating initializing contracts currently deployed on Goerli for the `BlueBerryBank` implementation contract and a `SoftVault` contract -
