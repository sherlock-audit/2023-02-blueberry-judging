# Earned interest is lost when withdrawing tokens lent to a bank

## Summary
When a user withdraws the tokens they previously lent to a bank, the interest earned in the "soft vault" is lost. While the "soft vault" does generate interest, it cannot be claim by users who lend tokens; the earn interest is left in the `BlueBerryBank` contract and cannot be withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol supports two types of vault for deposited collateral:
1. [soft vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L648) sends deposited tokens to [Compound's cTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/SoftVault.sol#L79), which [accrue interest](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/);
1. [hard vaults](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L77) stores tokens in itself.

Interest accrual in cTokens is achieved via the [exchange rate](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CToken.sol#L410) of tokens: borrowing increases the exchange rate, allowing lenders to [redeem](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CToken.sol#L496) their cTokens for more underlying tokens than they initially lent.

However, [BlueBerryBank.withdrawLend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L669) discards the amount above the initially lent one:
```solidity
wAmount = wAmount > pos.underlyingAmount
    ? pos.underlyingAmount
    : wAmount;
```

Thus, after withdrawing collateral, users will not receive the interest earned by the collateral in the respective cToken.
## Impact
Users lose the interest earned by lending collateral to borrowers.

## Recommendation
Consider letting users receive the full amount of collateral and the interest earned from lending the collateral to borrowers.
