# Unable to withdraw only LP tokens while closing positions

## Summary
````IchiVaultSpell#withdrawInternal()```` calls the ````withdraw()```` function from a given ICHI vault. There may be occasions that the withdraw amount parameter ````amtLPToRemove```` be zero, but the ````withdraw()```` function would revert on zero input. As a result, the users are unable to conduct their intended actions.

## Vulnerability Detail
````withdrawInternal()```` is called from ````closePosition()```` and ````closePositionFarm()````, after taking out the LP tokens by calling ````doTakeCollateral()````.
```solidity
    function closePosition(
    ...
        // 1. Take out collateral
        doTakeCollateral(strategies[strategyId].vault, lpTakeAmt);

        // 2-8. Remove liquidity
        withdrawInternal(
            strategyId,
            collToken,
            borrowToken,
            amountRepay,
            amountLpWithdraw,
            amountShareWithdraw
        );

    function closePositionFarm(
    ...
        // 1. Take out collateral
        bank.takeCollateral(lpTakeAmt);
        wIchiFarm.burn(collId, lpTakeAmt);
        doCutRewardsFee(ICHI);

        // 2-8. Remove liquidity
        withdrawInternal(
            strategyId,
            collToken,
            borrowToken,
            amountRepay,
            amountLpWithdraw,
            amountShareWithdraw
        );
```
In ````withdrawInternal````, it calculates the amount of LP tokens to convert to the initial deposit token.
```solidity
        // 2. Calculate actual amount to remove
        uint256 amtLPToRemove = vault.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            amountLpWithdraw;
```

If the user wants to keep all the withdrawal as LP tokens, the user can simply input ````amountLpWithdraw  = lpTakeAmt````, as the ````vault.balanceOf(address(this))```` should be same as ````lpTakeAmt````.
However, if then, ````amtLPToRemove```` would be zero, which leads to revert in ````vault.withdraw()````
```solidity
        // 3. Withdraw liquidity from ICHI vault
        vault.withdraw(amtLPToRemove, address(this));
```

in ICHIVault:
```solidity
2669:    function withdraw(uint256 shares, address to)
2670:        external
2671:        override
2672:        nonReentrant 
2673:        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
2674:    {
2675:        require(shares > 0, "IV.withdraw: shares");
```

## Impact
Users are unable to keep their withdrawal as LP tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checking logic before withdraw
```solidity
        // 3. Withdraw liquidity from ICHI vault
+       if(amtLPToRemove > 0)
            vault.withdraw(amtLPToRemove, address(this));
```
