# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval

## Summary
Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval
## Vulnerability Detail
Each calling `lend()` function , and a certain number of token is approved to `Vault`. But if it is a special token, the sometokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)'sÂ approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
