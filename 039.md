# Liquidate does not update the owner of the new position to the msg.sender after it has been completed

## Summary
The function Liquidate does not update the owner after the postion has been liquidatated 


## Vulnerability Detail
The function Liquidate can be called by anyone. After the msg.sender pays the debt for the owner, the function transfers the collateral to the msg.sender. However, there is no functionality to update the owner of the struct position after the position has been liquidated. Therefore if another person liquidates a position, the owner is not updated, meaning that the original owner never changes.


## Impact
Function getPositionInfo and  function getPositionIdsByOwner will not work properly.
