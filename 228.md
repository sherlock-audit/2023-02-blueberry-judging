# Using safeTransfer on a contract that doesn't have a transfer function and a missing reverting fallback function will give no indication of failure....leading to loss of funds.

## Summary
Using safeTransfer on a contract that doesn't have a transfer function and no reverting fallback function will give no indication of failure....leading to loss of funds.
```solidity
            ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, enIchi - stIchi);
```
## Vulnerability Detail
Going through IIchiV2.sol i don't see a transfer() function and a reverting fallback function, ICHI(IIchiV2.sol) was used with safeERC20Upgradable's safeTransfer. I researched and found out that safeTransfer will call callOptionalReturn which which perform a .call(..) for the non existent transfer function and since there's no reverting fallback function, it returns for this contract success=true and empty returndata which pass successfully the require statement and if and end the callOptionalReturn execution without revert and without any indication that the transfer did not happen.

If a solidity function has IERC20 token parameter then in runtime it allows to pass the contract above and cause the behavior described.

I think this is a problem that anybody who uses safeTransfer thinks that either transfer happened or revert happens but I showed a third case which might be used by an attacker for code flows manipulation.

## Impact
Using safeERC20Upgradeable.sol's safeTransfer with ICHI(IIchiV2.sol) contract won't give an indication of failure when tx fails(i.e, it will fail silently) because IIchiV2.sol doesn't have a transfer function and a reverting fallback function. THIS WILL LEAD TO LOSS OF FUNDS.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
rebuild ICHI(IIchiV2.sol) to have a transfer() function and a reverting fallback function.
