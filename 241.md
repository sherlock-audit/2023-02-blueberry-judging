# BlueberryBank borrow DOS by calling bToken's repayBorrowBehalf()

## Summary
A malicious user can pay back the bank's debt to make the borrow function will always revert due to division by 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L721-L723
^ This calculation divides by totalDebt but only checks if totalShare = 0. 

bToken is a fork of cTokens, which has a repayBorrowBehalf() function.

While totalShare != 0, a malicious user can call the bToken's repayBorrowBehalf() function to get the totalDebt to be 0.

## Impact
After the attack, borrow will always revert for the affected token.

## Code Snippet
I couldn't get my proof of concept to work. I'm not sure if it's because it's an issue on my end or if it's because repayBorrowBehalf() is not allowed in bToken. Reporting it anyway just to be safe.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation:
Regardless, the security of BlueBerryBank should not have to depend on the behavior of the bToken.

This issue can be mitigated by checking if totalDebt = 0 instead of totalShare.
