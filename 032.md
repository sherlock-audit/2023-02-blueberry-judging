# IchiVaultSpell#openPositionFarm can cause Ichi to be harvested but doesn't send it to the user

## Summary

When `openPositionFarm` is called and the user already has a farm position, the original position will be removed and then all the LP will be restaked. The problem is that the `WIchiFarm#burn` will result in the `Ichi` being harvested and sent to `IchiVaultSpell`. It should transfer these harvested tokens to the user but instead they aren't resulting in loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

      if (collSize > 0) {
          (uint256 decodedPid, ) = wIchiFarm.decodeId(collId);
          if (farmingPid != decodedPid) revert INCORRECT_PID(farmingPid);
          if (posCollToken != address(wIchiFarm))
              revert INCORRECT_COLTOKEN(posCollToken);
          bank.takeCollateral(collSize);
          wIchiFarm.burn(collId, collSize);
      }

`openPositionFarm` allows a user to both open a new positions and add to current positions. Due to how rewards are tracked by `WIchiFarm`, when adding to a position the users existing position must be withdrawn from `WIchiFarm` then redeposited. 

[WIchiFarm.sol#L142-L148](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/wrapper/WIchiFarm.sol#L142-L148)

      (uint256 enIchiPerShare, , ) = ichiFarm.poolInfo(pid);
      uint256 stIchi = (stIchiPerShare * amount).divCeil(1e18);
      uint256 enIchi = (enIchiPerShare * amount) / 1e18;

      if (enIchi > stIchi) {
          ICHI.safeTransfer(msg.sender, enIchi - stIchi);
      }

`WIchiFarm#burn` transfers `Ichi` to the user at the end of the call. These tokens belong to the user but are never transferred to them. These tokens are left in the contract and given to the next user that closes their position, cause loss of funds for the user that should have received them.

## Impact

User will have their `Ichi` rewards stolen by next user who closes a position

## Recommendation

Refund `Ichi` at the end of the withdraw block in `openPositionFarm`:

        if (collSize > 0) {
            (uint256 decodedPid, ) = wIchiFarm.decodeId(collId);
            if (farmingPid != decodedPid) revert INCORRECT_PID(farmingPid);
            if (posCollToken != address(wIchiFarm))
                revert INCORRECT_COLTOKEN(posCollToken);
            bank.takeCollateral(collSize);
            wIchiFarm.burn(collId, collSize);
    +       doCutRewardsFee(ICHI);
        }
