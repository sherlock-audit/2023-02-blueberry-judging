# Possible loss of funds in WIchiFarm.sol when minting.

## Summary
There is no check to make sure only ERC20 contracts can be used as _ichiFarm in WIchiFarm.sol's  initialize() function.

## Vulnerability Detail

A non-ERC20 contract can be inputted as _ichiFarm in the initialize() function in WIchiFarm.sol, as there is no check to make sure only ERC20 contracts can be used as _ichiFarm when initializing.
When minting, IERC20Upgradeable's safeTransferFrom is called with 'lpToken' which is the address inputted into _ichiFarm argument in the initialize() function. 
If it's a NON-ERC20 contract or a malicious contract, the funds could be lost.

## Impact
using a non-ERC20 contract as _ichiFarm(lpToken) will lead to loss of funds when minting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please put a check in the initialize() function to make sure that only ERC20 Contracts can be used as _ichiFarm, since IERC20Upgradeable's safeTransferFrom is used to transfer funds from msg.sender to the WIchiFarm.sol with lpToken(_ichiFarm) when minting.
