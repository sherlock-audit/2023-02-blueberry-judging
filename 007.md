# ISOLATED COLLATERALS CAN BE STOLEN AS THERE IS NO ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTED

## Summary
ISOLATED COLLATERALS CAN BE STOLEN AS THERE IS NO ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTED.

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to lack of  access control implementation anyone can make a call to reducePosition() function as it is external.


## Impact
The reducePosition() function calls BasicSpell's doRefund() which has a safeTransfer and calls  iBank's Executor() which returns an address.
This can be used to withdraw the collateral of another user by inputting the address of the collateral. There is no check to make sure that a user can't withdraw another user's collateral, i.e a check to make sure that collaterals can only be withdrawn by the depositor.
Also the supposed check for strategyid is called only after doRefund() is called.
```solidity
  doRefund(collToken);
  _validateMaxLTV(strategyId);
```
## Code Snippet
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/spell/IchiVaultSpell.sol#L266-L274
```solidity
    function doRefund(address token) internal {
        uint256 balance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance > 0) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(bank.EXECUTOR(), balance);
        }
    }
```
```solidity
    function EXECUTOR() external view returns (address);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
implement Access control on the reducePosition() external function, i.e put a check to make sure that it's only the owner of the isolated collateral that can reduce the position.
